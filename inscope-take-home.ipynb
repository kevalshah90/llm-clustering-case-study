    "- [x] You will write a data pipeline to process the provided HTML into an intermediate representation that can be used for clustering. One of the features in your intermediate representation should be a 1-paragraph summary of the report. You can use any pre-trained language model you like to generate the summary.\n",

Additionally, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to \"U.S.\" are to the United States of America and Puerto Rico, collectively.3PART IItem 1.    BusinessOverviewWe own, operate and lease shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., including (1) more than 40,000 towers and other structures, such as rooftops (collectively, \"towers\"), (2) approximately 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (3) approximately 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cells and fiber solutions. We refer to our towers, small cells and fiber assets collectively as \"communications infrastructure,\" and to our customers on our communications infrastructure as \"tenants.\" Our operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber, which includes both small cells and fiber solutions. Our core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to our shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). We seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure, which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Over the last two decades, we have assembled a leading portfolio of towers predominately through acquisitions from large wireless carriers or their predecessors. More recently, both through acquisitions and new construction of small cells and fiber, we have extended our communications infrastructure presence by investing significantly in our Fiber segment. Through our product offerings of towers and small cells, we seek to provide a comprehensive solution to enable our wireless tenants to expand coverage and capacity for their wireless networks. Furthermore, within our Fiber segment, we seek to generate cash flow growth and stockholder return by deploying our fiber for both small cells' and fiber solutions' tenants.Approximately 56% and 71% of our towers are located in the 50 and 100 largest U.S. basic trading areas (\"BTAs\"), respectively. Our towers have a significant presence in each of the top 100 BTAs. We derive approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we own, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, and we derive approximately 60% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we lease, sublease, manage or license. The contracts for the land under our towers have an average total remaining life of approximately 36 years (including all renewal terms exercisable at our option), weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. The majority of our small cells and fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas, including a presence within every major U.S. market. The vast majority of our fiber assets are located on public rights-of-way. Our largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which collectively accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2022 consolidated site rental revenues. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. Site rental revenues represented 90% of our 2022 consolidated net revenues, of which 69% and 31% were from our Towers segment and Fiber segment, respectively. Within our Fiber segment, 68% and 32% of our 2022 site rental revenues related to fiber solutions and small cells, respectively. The vast majority of our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and are derived from long-term tenant contracts. See \"Item 1. Business—The Company\" for further information. As of December 31, 2022, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants' option, our tenant contracts had a weighted-average remaining life of approximately six years and represented $40 billion of expected future cash inflows. As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). StrategyAs a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per-share results. The key elements of our strategy are to:•Grow cash flows from our existing communications infrastructure. We are focused on maximizing the recurring site rental cash flows generated from providing our tenants with long-term access to our shared infrastructure assets, 4which we believe is the core driver of value for our stockholders. Tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment (collectively, \"tenant additions\") enable our tenants to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for data, while generating high incremental returns for our business. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells through our shared communications infrastructure model provide a comprehensive, efficient and cost-effective solution for our wireless tenants' growing networks. Additionally, we believe our ability to share our fiber assets across multiple tenants to both deploy small cells and offer fiber solutions allows us to generate cash flows and increase stockholder return.•Return cash generated by operating activities to common stockholders in the form of dividends. We believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities appropriately provides common stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected long-term stockholder value while still allowing us to retain sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth. We believe this decision reflects the translation of the high-quality, long-term contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to common stockholders.•Invest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. In addition to adding tenants to existing communications infrastructure, we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. These investments include constructing and acquiring new communications infrastructure that we expect will generate future cash flow growth and attractive long-term returns by adding tenants to those assets over time. Our historical investments have included the following (in no particular order):◦construction of towers, fiber and small cells; ◦acquisitions of towers, fiber and small cells; ◦acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); ◦improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; ◦purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and ◦purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. Our strategy to create long-term stockholder value is based on our belief that there will be considerable future demand for our communications infrastructure based on the location of our assets and the rapid and continuing growth in the demand for data. We believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue, will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure, and will create other growth opportunities for us, such as demand for newly constructed or acquired communications infrastructure, as described above. Further, we seek to augment the long-term value creation associated with growing our recurring site rental cash flows by offering certain ancillary site development and installation services within our Towers segment.REIT StatusWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and, therefore, are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income or assets, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income, (2) taxes related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"), (3) franchise taxes, (4) property taxes and (5) transfer taxes. In addition, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. For taxable years beginning before 2026, qualified REIT dividends (within the meaning of Section 199A(e)(3) of the Code) constitute a part of a non-corporate taxpayer's \"qualified business income amount\" and thus our non-corporate U.S. stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20% of such dividends received from us. Without further legislative action, the 20% deduction applicable to qualified REIT dividends will expire on January 1, 2026.The vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the REIT. See notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.Our foreign assets and operations (including our tower operations in Puerto Rico) most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether or not they are included in a TRS.5To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, after the utilization of our NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) (see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements). Our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for risks associated with our REIT status. Industry OverviewConsumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidth-intensive devices. This increase in data consumption is driven by factors such as growth in (1) mobile entertainment (such as mobile video, mobile applications and social networking), (2) mobile internet usage (supporting web browsing and trends in telehealth, remote working, online learning and other remote communications), (3) machine-to-machine applications or the \"Internet of Things\" (such as connected cars and smart city technologies), and (4) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications). As a result, consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidth-intensive devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other emerging and embedded devices, and U.S. wireless carriers are among the first carriers in the world to begin offering commercial 5th Generation (\"5G\") mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth.We expect the following factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure:•consumers' growing wireless data consumption leading major wireless carriers to upgrade and enhance their networks through the efficient use of both towers and small cells, including in connection with 5G deployments, in an effort to improve network quality and capacity and customer retention or satisfaction;•prior and future potential spectrum auctioned, licensed or made available by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") enabling additional wireless carrier network development; •next-generation technologies and new uses for wireless communications may potentially result in new entrants or increased demand in the wireless industry, which may include companies involved in the continued evolution and deployment of the Internet of Things; •the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive applications could result in demand for high-capacity, multi-location, fiber-based network solutions; and•increased government initiatives to expand broadband infrastructure to support connectivity throughout the U.S.The CompanyVirtually all of our operations in both our Towers and Fiber operating segments are located in the U.S. For more information about our operating segments, see \"Item 7. MD&A—Results of Operations\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Our core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to our shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in the U.S. We believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our tenants' networks and organizations. See \"Item 1. Business—Strategy.\"Towers Segment. We believe towers are the most efficient and cost-effective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments. We acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the largest U.S. wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999, including towers from (1) AT&T in 2013, (2) T-Mobile in 2012, (3) companies now part of T-Mobile in 2007, (4) companies now part of Verizon Wireless in 1999 and 2000 and (5) companies now part of AT&T in 1999 and 2000.We generally receive monthly rental payments and, in some cases, upfront payments, from our Towers tenants pursuant to long-term tenant contracts with (1) initial contract terms of five to 15 years, (2) multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each, exercisable at the option of the tenant, (3) limited termination rights for our tenants and (4) contractual escalations of the rental price. We strive to negotiate with our existing tenant base for longer contractual terms, which often contain fixed escalation rates.Our Towers tenant contracts, while amended and re-negotiated over time, have historically led to a long-term relationship with tenants on our towers, resulting in a retention rate generally between 98% and 99% each year. In general, each renewable tenant contract automatically renews at the end of its term unless (1) the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew or (2) the contract is amended or re-negotiated. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding expected higher non-renewals (which we define as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates) as a result of the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. See note 3 to our 6consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts without consideration of tenant renewal options as of December 31, 2022.The average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on (1) aggregate tenant volume, (2) the location of the tower, or (3) the amount of tower and ground space leased to a tenant, which can be influenced by the quantity, size, and weight of the tenant's antenna installation or related equipment. When possible, we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with tenant contract amendments, pursuant to which our tenants add antennas or other equipment to our towers or ground space on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting tenant contracts. Our Towers tenant contracts and pricing are not influenced by whether or not we perform the respective site development or installation services. See \"—Services\" below for a further discussion of our tower installation services. As of December 31, 2022, the average number of tenants (calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto) per tower was approximately 2.4.Fiber Segment. Our Fiber segment consists of small cells and fiber solutions. •Our small cells offload data traffic from towers and bolster our tenants' network capacity where data demand is the greatest and are typically attached to public right-of-way infrastructure, including utility poles and street lights.•We offer fiber solutions to large wireless carriers and organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands. Our fiber solutions provide essential connectivity resources needed to create integrated networks and support organizations. Most of our fiber assets were acquired through transactions dating back to 2012, with the largest transactions occurring in 2017. Our fiber assets include those we acquired from: (1) NextG Networks, Inc. in 2012, (2) Quanta Fiber Networks, Inc. in 2015, (3) FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC and certain other subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, Inc. in 2017, (4) Wilcon Holdings LLC in 2017 and (5) LTS Group Holdings LLC in 2017.We generally receive monthly recurring payments and, in some cases, upfront payments, from our Fiber tenants pursuant to tenant contracts with initial terms that generally vary between three to 20 years. The average monthly rental payment from a new tenant can vary based on the amount or cost of (1) construction for initial and subsequent tenants, (2) fiber strand requirements and supply, (3) equipment at the site, (4) the market in the U.S. where the fiber is located and (5) any upfront payment received.Additional Site Rental Information. For both our Towers and Fiber segments, we have existing master agreements with our largest tenants, including T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Such agreements provide certain terms (including economic terms) that govern underlying contracts (entered into during the term of the master agreements) regarding the right to use our communications infrastructure by such tenants.Approximately half of our site rental costs of operations consists of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses (primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure), property taxes, repairs and maintenance, employee compensation or related benefit costs, and utilities. Assuming current leasing activity levels, our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation. We seek to add tenants to our existing communications infrastructure at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns to our business. Once constructed, our communications infrastructure requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures, including maintenance or other non-discretionary capital expenditures, which are typically between 1% and 2% of net revenues. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental payments we owe to landlords pursuant to our operating lease agreements.Services. As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. In 2022, approximately 45% of our services and other revenues related to installation services, and the remainder predominately related to site development services. We seek to grow our services revenues by capitalizing on (1) increased leasing volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades, (2) promoting site development services, (3) expanding the scope of our services, and (4) focusing on tenant service and deployment speed. We have the capability and expertise to install, with the assistance of our network of subcontractors, equipment or antenna systems for our tenants. We do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our tenants on our communications infrastructure as other service providers also provide these services (see also \"—Competition\" below). These services are typically non-recurring and highly competitive, with several competitors in most markets. Typically, our site development services and installation services are billed on a fixed fee basis, and the terms and pricing of both site development services and installation services are negotiated separately from our tenant contracts.7Customers. Our Towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks.Our Fiber customers generally consist of large wireless carriers and organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands, such as enterprise (including healthcare and financial), wholesale, government and education institutions.Our three largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Collectively, these three tenants accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2022 site rental revenues. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for risks associated with our dependence on a small number of customers and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. For 2022, our site rental revenues by tenant were as follows:Sales and Marketing. Our sales organization markets our communications infrastructure with the objective of contracting access with tenants to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction. We seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our tenants and increase tenant satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our (1) existing unique communications infrastructure footprint, (2) tenant relationships, (3) process-centric approach, (4) technological tools and (5) construction capabilities and expertise.Our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors, including tenant type (such as large wireless carriers, vertical customers and organizations), product offering and geography. A team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest tenants. These directors work to develop new business opportunities, as well as to ensure that tenants' communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts for our communications infrastructure. Sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our tenants that are expanding their networks, entering new markets, seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings, bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add-on business. In addition to our full-time sales or marketing staff, a number of senior-level employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective tenants.Competition. We face competition for site rental tenants from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including competitors that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors, such as cable providers) or small cells, (2) tenants who elect to self-perform or (3) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.Some of our largest competitors in the Towers segment are American Tower Corporation and SBA Communications Corporation. Our Fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography. Some of the larger competitors in the Fiber segment include other owners of fiber, tenants who elect to self-perform and recent and potential entrants into small cells and the fiber solutions business. We believe that location, existing communications infrastructure footprint, deployment speed, quality of service, expertise, reputation, capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of competition in our industry.Competitors to our services offering can include site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners or managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, our tenants' internal staff or contractors, or telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors. We believe that our tenants base their decisions on the outsourcing of services on criteria such as a company's experience, record of accomplishment, reputation, price and time for completion of a project.8Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")Our shared communications infrastructure model results in the use of fewer resources, including water, energy, metals and other materials, than would otherwise be needed to construct and maintain communications infrastructure. We are committed to operating responsibly and ethically and considering social and environmental impacts as we make business decisions. We maintain annual sustainability targets in our senior unsecured credit facility. Further, we have a goal to be carbon neutral by 2025 in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by continuing to invest in energy reduction initiatives, sourcing renewable energy, and, to a lesser extent, utilizing carbon credits or offsets. We plan to continue investing in projects that are both good for our business and good for the environment.The Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee assists the board of directors with ESG oversight. Our executive management team and senior management keep our board of directors apprised of our ESG priorities, goals and initiatives. Together, our board of directors and executive management team define our strategic approach to managing actual and potential impacts of significant ESG risks and opportunities.Additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and progress is also available through the Investors section of our website at https://investor.crowncastle.com. The information on our website, including our ESG Reports, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference into this 2022 Form 10-K or any other filings with the SEC unless expressly noted in any such other filings.Human CapitalThe people who work for Crown Castle are essential to our ability to execute on our strategy. As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 5,000 people, all of whom were based in the U.S. From time to time, we also add contingent workers to support our business.We believe attracting, developing and retaining talented employees is paramount to serving our customers and our communities and creating value for our stockholders. Our core values shape our culture, drive our decision-making and guide our interactions with one another and our customers. Our 2022 annual employee survey indicated strong employee engagement exceeding U.S. company norms.We continue to focus on building and retaining a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive community to make our company stronger and more innovative. We actively partner with non-profit and community organizations to create a diverse talent pipeline. In addition, our board of directors is currently comprised of 60% female or racially diverse directors, including each of the four most recently appointed directors.The well-being of our employees is a crucial element of our safety culture, employee engagement and productivity. We offer a competitive total rewards package which includes market-based pay, performance-based annual incentive awards, healthcare and retirement benefits, mental health benefits, parental and family leave, holiday and paid time off and tuition assistance. We further invest in our employees' professional growth and development by providing resources and opportunities to hone their skills and expand their subject-matter expertise, which empowers them to advance their careers and enables our business to prosper. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages.Regulatory and Environmental MattersWe are required to comply with a variety of federal, state and local regulations and laws in the U.S., including FCC and Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") regulations and those discussed under \"—Environmental\" below. To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations, including any environmental regulations. The summary below is based on regulations currently in effect, and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be fined or lose our rights to conduct some of our business.Federal Regulations. Both the FCC and the FAA regulate towers used for wireless communications, radio, or television broadcasting. Such regulations control the siting, construction, modification, lighting, and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require the registration of tower facilities with the FCC and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used. In addition, the FCC and the FAA have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location, including proximity to airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights 9are reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation, which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements. The FCC requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with FAA rules and are registered with the FCC, if required by its regulations. Where tower lighting is required by FAA regulation, tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages.State and Local Regulations. The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities' jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells. The law, however, limits state and local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by such authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or prohibit altogether (actually or effectively) the provision of wireless communications. Additionally, the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations.Local regulations include city and other local ordinances (including subdivision and zoning ordinances), approvals for construction, modification and removal of towers and small cells, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require us to obtain prior approval from local officials. Local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or small cells, or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents' concerns regarding the height, visibility, or other characteristics of such infrastructure. Over the last several years, the FCC has adopted regulations and 30 states have passed legislation intended to expedite and streamline the deployment of wireless networks, including establishing presumptively reasonable timeframes for reviews by local and state governments. Notwithstanding such developments, decisions of local regulatory authorities and utilities in certain jurisdictions may continue to adversely affect deployment timing and cost. Certain of our subsidiaries hold state authorizations, including authorizations to act as competitive local exchange carriers (\"CLECs\"), to provide intrastate telecommunication services in addition to FCC authorization to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services. State authorizations may help promote access to public rights-of-way, which is beneficial to the timely deployment of fiber and small cells, and often allow us to deploy such infrastructure in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay, restrict, or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower and rooftop sites. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding rights to our infrastructure.Environmental. We are required to comply with a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality, including air and water quality, and wildlife. To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding compliance with laws and regulations.The construction of new towers and small cells or, in some cases, their modification in the U.S. may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (\"NEPA\"), which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions. NEPA regulations require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction. If the FCC determines that the proposed tower or small cells construction or modification presents a significant environmental impact, the FCC is required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which is subject to public comment. Such determination could significantly delay the FCC's approval of the construction or modification.Our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission, or remediation of, or exposure to, hazardous or non-hazardous substances, materials, or wastes. As an owner, lessee, or operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint-and-several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination relating to existing or historical operations; or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination. In general, our tenant contracts prohibit our tenants from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our tenants to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them.We are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure. In recent years, the scientific community has extensively studied low-level radio frequency emissions to determine whether they have any connection to certain negative health effects, such as cancer.We have compliance programs and monitoring projects designed to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us.10Available InformationWe maintain a website at www.crowncastle.com.

Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).Tenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on consumers' and organizations' demand for data. Additionally, the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure, or renew or extend existing tenant contracts on our communications infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:•availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests;•location of our communications infrastructure;•financial condition of our tenants, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital, including through government funding;•willingness of our tenants to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;•need for integrated networks and organizations;•availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;•increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our tenants;•mergers or consolidations by and among our tenants;•changes in, or success of, our tenants' business models;•governmental regulations and initiatives, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure;•cost of constructing communications infrastructure;•our market competition, including tenants that may elect to self-perform;•technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; and•our ability to efficiently satisfy our tenants' service requirements.A slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. If our current or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services. The amount, timing, and mix of our tenants' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. Changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure. As a result, changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new and emerging technologies (including small cells and fiber solutions), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Furthermore, the industries in which our tenants operate (particularly those in the wireless industry) could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for data or general economic conditions. There can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services. In addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services. Such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.12A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues, reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services and impact our dividend per share growth.Our three largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. The loss of any one of our largest tenants as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, communications infrastructure assets, or intangible assets (including goodwill), or (4) other adverse effects to our business. We cannot guarantee that tenant contracts with our largest tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their tenant contracts with us. In addition to our three largest tenants, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from (1) fiber solutions tenants and (2) new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services. Such tenants (including those dependent on government funding) may be smaller or have less financial resources than our three largest tenants, may have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital. Consolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example, where they are co-residents on a tower or small cell network, which may result in the termination, non-renewal or re-negotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant contracts, we generally expect that the impact to our site rental revenues from any termination of our tenant contracts as a result of such potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. Such consolidation (or potential consolidation) may result in a reduction or slowdown in such tenants' network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. Tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure and services, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain long-lived assets.On January 6, 2022, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile that contemplates T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. We anticipate that this consolidation will result in higher Towers non-renewals in 2025, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $200 million. Except for full year 2025, we expect our annual Towers non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues. Additionally, we anticipate that the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation will result in small cell non-renewals, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $45 million, with approximately half occurring in 2023 and the remainder occurring in 2024 and 2025. Excluding the anticipated impact from the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation, we expect consolidated annual small cell non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues.Due to network consolidation non-renewals and interest rate increases discussed in \"—Risks Related to Our Debt and Equity,\" we expect our annual dividend per share growth through 2025 to be below our long-term annual target.See \"Item 1. Business—The Company\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. We seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings, or other strategic growth opportunities. In the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. Such transactions or activities could be complex, costly and time-consuming, or cause disruptions in, increase risk to or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things, such transactions and activities may: •disrupt our business relationships with our tenants, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;•divert capital and the time or attention of management away from other business operations, including as a result of post-transaction integration activities;•fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated; •increase operational risk or volatility in our business; •not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected;•impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees; •increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees; or13•result in the need for additional TRSs or contributions of certain assets to TRSs, which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Over the last decade, we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our Fiber business, which is a much less mature business for us than our Towers business. Our Fiber segment represented 31% and 33% of our site rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The business model for our Fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our Towers operations, including those relating to tenant base, competition, contract terms (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), upfront capital requirements, landlord demographics, deployment and ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements, government regulations, growth rates and applicable laws.While our Fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our Towers operations, they also have certain operational risks (including the scalability of processes) that are different from our Towers business, including:•the use of public rights-of-way and franchise agreements; •the use of poles and conduits owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties; •risks relating to overbuilding competitive fiber assets; •risks relating to the specific markets in which we choose or plan to operate;•risks relating to construction hazards, including boring, trenching, utility and maintenance of traffic hazards;•construction management and construction-related billings to tenants;•risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks, or tenants utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets;•the risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands;•damage to our assets and the need to maintain, repair, upgrade and periodically replace our assets;•the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software;•network data security risks; •the risk of new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber; •potential damage to our overall reputation as a communications infrastructure provider; and•the use of CLEC status.In addition, the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether. For example, our tenants have initially focused on utilizing towers in the first phase of deploying their 5G networks, which has led to delays in some of our small cell deployments. We anticipate that these delays will be temporary, as our tenants plan for the next phase of their 5G network deployment which we believe will require small cells at scale. Our Fiber operations also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our Towers business as a result of numerous factors, including those stemming from the deployment, location or nature of the assets involved. There may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve, and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.Our construction projects and related contracts can be long-term, complex in nature, dangerous, costly and challenging to execute. The quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage (1) the associated tenant relationship and (2) the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources. In connection with our construction projects, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, labor availability and productivity, and contractor pricing and performance.In addition, the construction projects (including modifications of existing communications infrastructure) can pose certain safety risks, including:•risks resulting from elevated work, including falling hazards;•risks of third-party non-compliance with safety regulations, industry best practices or other applicable standards;•risks associated with utility hazards, including gas line, electrical or sewage strikes, which may result in explosions, electrocution and other potentially catastrophic events; and•risk of potential wildfires, including due to welding, grinding, cutting, or other construction activity.14Such safety risks may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, suspension of operations or services, or significant damage to the environment, creating financial, regulatory or reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. See \"Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events\" below for additional information regarding potential adverse impacts to our business which may result from wildfires and other climate-related events.Further, investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels. Additionally, contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. We often experience unforeseen delays from municipalities and utility companies that result in longer construction timelines than expected, which impact our ability to timely deliver on our projects. We may also experience unforeseen delays and increased project costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which may impact the availability of equipment and materials needed for, and availability of contractors to work on, our construction projects. Our failure to manage such tenant relationships, project resources, and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner and appropriately manage safety risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.Improvements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure. For example, new technologies and spectrum that may promote network sharing, joint development, backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants, such as signal combining technologies or network virtualization, may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure. In addition, other technologies, such as WiFi, blimps, satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed. In addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.The property interests and other rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land under our towers, are derived from leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and franchise and other agreements. A loss of these interests and other rights may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms.Our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers are located depends on our ability to purchase such land, by acquiring fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the agreements relating to such land. Approximately 10% of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years. If we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located, our business may be adversely affected.As of December 31, 2022, approximately 53% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. Even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the T-Mobile or AT&T towers for business or other reasons. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. Additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of December 31, 2022 is as follows:•22% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master lease or other related agreements with AT&T for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the 15respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.•31% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases or other agreements with T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). Approximately half of such towers have an initial term of 32 years (through May 2037), and we have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of such leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile for approximately $2.3 billion. The remainder of such towers have a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase such towers from T-Mobile at the end of the respective terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. In addition, another 1% of our towers under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with T-Mobile are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with AT&T. We have the option to purchase these towers from AT&T at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due prior to 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).Under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to operate and manage, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. If one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. If our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.For our small cells and fiber, we must maintain rights-of-way, franchise, pole attachment, conduit use, fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct, maintain and operate our fiber assets. Access to rights-of-way may depend on our CLEC status, and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will (1) recognize such CLEC status or (2) not change their laws concerning CLEC access to rights-of-way. If a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed, we might be forced to abandon our assets, which may adversely impact our business. In order to operate our assets, we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms, we may face increased costs or reduced revenues.Additionally, in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations, we often need to obtain new or additional rights-of-way and other agreements. Our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and cost-effective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint, which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.The operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its non-recurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. Our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•competition;•the timing, mix and amount of tenant network investments;•the rate and volume of tenant deployment plans;•unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;•economic weakness or uncertainty;•labor availability and productivity;•our market share; and•changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.16If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies (such as 5G) may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new wireless technologies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services and technologies. If a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Despite existing security measures, certain of our information technology and communications infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious software, cyber-attacks and other security breaches. In addition, our increased reliance on cloud- or internet-based services and on remote access to information systems to accommodate our hybrid work environment increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity incidents. An attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants or access by our tenants to certain of our information technology systems, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants, (3) data transmitted over our tenants' networks being compromised or misappropriated, or (4) business or other sensitive data being compromised, misappropriated or lost. Although we believe we have a comprehensive incident response plan and other cybersecurity measures and policies in place, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. Additionally, security incidents impacting our tenants, vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. If an actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity or information technology, or that of our cloud- or internet-based service providers, occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose tenants. Further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. In addition, our acquisitions, both past and future, may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above. While we maintain insurance that includes coverage in the event of cybersecurity or other information technology breaches, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such incidents.Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.We could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events, such as extreme weather events or natural disasters (including as a result of any potential effects of climate change), or acts of vandalism. There is increasing concern that global climate change is occurring and could result in increased frequency of certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Although we have implemented a wildfire risk mitigation program, the effects of climate change have increased the risk and extent of wildfires that could potentially result from certain of our construction and maintenance projects and other operating activities. We cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our business. Any such unforeseen events could, among other things, damage or delay deployment of our communications infrastructure, interrupt or delay service to our tenants or could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.While we currently maintain insurance policies that include coverage in the event of natural disasters and other unforeseen events, including possible incidents in which our actions (or the actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to such events, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such events. Further, we do not maintain, and do not expect to maintain, insurance policies that provide adequate coverage in the event that our actions (or those actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to a wildfire event, as a result of the fact that such insurance policies are generally not economically available.17As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.Our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts (including amendments to tenant contracts upon modification of existing towers, small cells or fiber), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate. Competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. In addition, competition (primarily in our fiber solutions business) may, in certain circumstances, cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations. We face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including those that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors such as cable providers) or small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.Our Fiber business generally has different competitors than those in our Towers business, including other owners of fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions, some of which may have larger networks, greater financial resources or more experience in managing such assets than we have.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.There can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies, which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure, will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. In addition, demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.Our focus on and disclosure of our ESG position, metrics, strategy, goals and initiatives expose us to potential litigation and other adverse effects to our business.In recent years, our investors, tenants, employees and other stakeholders have increased their focus on ESG matters and disclosure. In response, we have published ESG reports and related materials and made other public announcements regarding our ESG position, initiatives and goals. Our ESG metrics, initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards that are still developing and that may not be uniformly adopted or applied by other companies, processes and internal controls that continue to evolve, potentially missing or deficient third-party data, wide range of acceptable estimation techniques, and estimates and assumptions that are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty and may change more frequently than those underlying our financial metrics. Our ESG initiatives and goals may be difficult to implement and may increase operating costs and result in changes to certain of our operations, assets and processes. In addition, a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations are developing climate change-based laws and regulations, with varying scopes and complexity, that could, if adopted, significantly increase compliance burdens and associated costs.Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, accurately report our metrics or adhere to public statements exposes us to potential litigation, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.We operate in a challenging labor market and failure to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees could adversely affect our business, operations and costs. Our ability to sustain and grow our business and execute on our strategy requires us, in part, to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key management personnel and other talent. We have experienced an extremely competitive labor market that continues to tighten due to macroeconomic conditions and elevated levels of turnover stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. To remain competitive, some employers are offering increased compensation and benefits and opportunities to work with greater flexibility, including remote work on a permanent basis. We currently operate under a hybrid work model, meaning that the majority of our employees have the flexibility to work remotely for a portion of the workweek. As the competition for talent remains intense, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs to attract, recruit and retain necessary talent, including increased compensation, benefits or other employee-related costs. Our failure to successfully attract, recruit and retain key employees could adversely impact our business, operations, and costs.18Risks Related to Our Debt and EquityOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $21.7 billion as of February 21, 2023). See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. As a result of our substantial indebtedness:•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;•we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;•we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\";•we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;•we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;•we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates (see below);•we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments;•we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet our debt payment obligations;•we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; and•we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT due to limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.Over the past 11 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate eight times for a cumulative increase of 4.50% and has signaled further increases in the near-term, which could further increase interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of February 21, 2023, approximately 12% of our outstanding indebtedness consisted of variable interest rates, with a weighted average rate of 5.6%. Any significant increase in the amount of our variable rate debt or interest rate on such debt could adversely impact our borrowing cost, financial results and our ability to meet our dividend growth targets, strategically deploy our capital or execute our business plan. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our interest rate risk.Currently we have debt instruments in place that limit, in certain circumstances, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. In addition, the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility (\"2016 Credit Agreement\"), which consists of our senior unsecured term loan A facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively, \"2016 Credit Facility\"), contains financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. Furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. If our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.CCI is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, CCI's sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. Earnings and cash flows generated by CCI's subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to CCI, in the absence of any special conditions, such as a continuing event of default. However, CCI's subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.19We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which, upon final maturity, we will need to refinance or repay. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all. As of February 21, 2023, approximately 51% of our fixed rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%, is scheduled to mature over the next five years. If interest rates remain elevated or continue to increase, we may have to (1) refinance our maturing fixed rate debt at interest rates that exceed the current interest rates on such debt or (2) use our variable interest rate debt to repay such fixed rate debt, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.Economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact (1) the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above, (2) our ability to draw the full amount of our $7.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Facility (\"2016 Revolver\"), that, as of February 21, 2023, had $6.7 billion of undrawn availability, or (3) our ability to issue the full amount of the $2.0 billion commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\") under our unsecured commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), that, as of February 21, 2023, had $1.2 billion outstanding.If we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. In such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations. Failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. Our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. We maintain an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program (\"2021 ATM Program\") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million to or through sales agents. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2021 ATM Program. From time to time, we may refresh or implement a new \"at-the-market\" stock offering program. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately 433 million shares of common stock outstanding.We have reserved an aggregate of approximately 16 million of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our stock compensation plans.Further, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, (\"Charter\"), amended and restated by-laws (\"By-laws\") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti-takeover provisions include:•the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; •advance notice and other procedural requirements relating to director nominations or proposals submitted by stockholders for actions to be taken at annual meetings of stockholders; and•provisions that the state courts or, in certain circumstances, the federal courts, in Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us, our directors, officers, employees and stockholders, and, unless the 20Company otherwise consents, that the federal courts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). Since the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought pursuant to the Securities Act, there may be uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. Stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws, and this provision does not apply to claims for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction (such as under the Exchange Act).Our By-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our Chief Executive Officer or the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.In addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.Risks Relating to Corporate ComplianceIf we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.A variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in \"Item 1. Business.\" Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties, require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws, will not adversely affect our business (including our REIT status), increase delays or result in additional costs. We also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations, such as those governing environmental and safety matters. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us.Risks Relating to Our REIT StatusFuture dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.During each of the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, totaling approximately $1.9 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.565 per share, which represents an increase of 6.5% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2022. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. Any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs) to our stockholders. Our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See also \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend.\" As discussed in \"Item 1. Business—Strategy,\" we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. Our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): construction of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. External financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. As a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.21Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, thereby increasing our tax obligations and reducing our available cash.As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders.While we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the importance of ongoing factual determinations, the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting REITs, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year. In addition, the present U.S. federal tax treatment of REITs is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and any such change might adversely affect our REIT status or benefits. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that such changes, if enacted, might have on our business. However, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business, including our REIT status. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, then:•we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income;•we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and, for years beginning before January 1, 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax; and•we would be disqualified from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified.Although we may have federal NOLs available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal NOLs have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.Under the Code, for taxable years beginning in or after 2018, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. These limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a REIT.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are required to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement as described above. We commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal NOLs of approximately $1.5 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.From time to time, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would 22otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Furthermore, the REIT dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.In addition to satisfying the 90% distribution requirement, to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. Compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent, limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. In addition, our status as a REIT may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.Moreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock. In order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer \"individuals\" (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year. In order to facilitate compliance with the REIT rules, our Charter includes provisions regarding REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any \"person\" (as defined in our Charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than (1) 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or (2) 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock. In addition, our Charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. These ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders. CertificationsWe submitted the Chief Executive Officer certification required by Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") Listed Company Manual, relating to compliance with the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards, to the NYSE on May 26, 2022 with no qualifications. We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this 2022 Form 10-K.23Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.     PropertiesCommunications Infrastructure We own, lease or manage more than 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. Towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 300 feet. Our tenants' wireless equipment may be placed on towers, building rooftops and other structures. Our towers are located on tracts of land that support the towers, equipment shelters and, where applicable, guy-wires to stabilize the tower.Additionally, we own or lease approximately 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting our (1) approximately 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (2) fiber solutions. The majority of our fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas. Our small cells and fiber are typically located outdoors and are often attached to public right-of-way infrastructure, including utility poles or street lights. See the following for further information regarding our communications infrastructure:•\"Item 1. Business—Overview\" for information regarding our tower and fiber portfolios.•\"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material Cash Requirements\" for information regarding our lease obligations.•\"Schedule III - Schedule of Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\" for further information on our productive properties.Approximately 53% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a further discussion. Substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications. Additionally, if so inclined as a result of a request for a tenant addition, we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower, replace a small cell network antenna with another antenna or overlay additional fiber in order to provide additional coverage or capacity, subject to certain restrictions.OfficesOur principal corporate headquarters is owned and located in Houston, Texas. In addition, we have offices throughout the U.S. in locations convenient for the management and operation of our communications infrastructure, with significant consideration being given to the amount of our communications infrastructure located in a particular area. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.Item 3.     Legal ProceedingsWe are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Most of these proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business involve disputes with landlords, vendors, collection matters involving bankrupt tenants, zoning or siting matters, construction, condemnation, tax, employment, or wrongful termination matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us.See the disclosure in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.Item 4.     Mine Safety DisclosuresN/A24PART IIItem 5.     Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and HoldersOur common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"CCI.\" As of February 21, 2023, there were approximately 542 holders of record of our common stock.Dividend PolicyWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income after the utilization of any available NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). See also \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities—Common Stock\" and notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements.Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our growth in cash flows. The declaration amount and payment of any future dividends, however, are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on then-current or anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing NOLs, or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited under certain circumstances by the terms of our debt instruments.25Performance GraphThe following performance graph is a comparison of the five-year cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock against the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Market Index and the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index for the period commencing December 31, 2017 and ending December 31, 2022.

See \"Item 1. Business\" for a further discussion of our business, including our long-term strategy, our REIT status, certain key terms of our tenant contracts and growth trends in the demand for data. Site rental revenues represented 90% of our 2022 consolidated net revenues. The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in prior years.Highlights of Business Fundamentals and Results•We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes (see \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements)•Potential growth resulting from the increasing demand for data ◦We expect existing and potential new tenant demand for our communications infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of mobile entertainment, mobile internet, and machine-to-machine applications, (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including the use of both towers and small cells, (6) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications), (7) the availability of additional spectrum and (8) increased government initiatives to support connectivity throughout the U.S.◦We expect U.S. wireless carriers will continue to focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity (including through 5G initiatives) by utilizing a combination of towers and small cells. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless tenants' growing communications infrastructure needs. ◦We expect organizations will continue to increase the usage of high-bandwidth applications that will require the utilization of more fiber infrastructure and fiber solutions, such as those we provide. ◦Within our Fiber segment, we are able to generate growth and returns for our stockholders by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions tenants. ◦Tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure are achieved at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns. ◦Substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications.•Returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also \"Item 1. Business—Strategy\")◦During 2022, we paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $2.6 billion. See \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend\" for a discussion of the increase to our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2022.•Investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share ◦We had discretionary capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, predominately resulting from the construction of new communications infrastructure and improvements to existing communications infrastructure in order to support additional tenants. ◦We expect to continue to construct and acquire new communications infrastructure based on our tenants' needs and generate attractive long-term returns by adding additional tenants over time. •Site rental revenues under long-term tenant contracts◦Our wireless tenant contracts have initial terms of five to 15 years with contractual escalators and multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each, exercisable at the option of the tenant. ◦Our fiber solutions tenant contracts' initial terms generally vary between three to 20 years (including tenant contracts with organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands). ◦As of December 31, 2022, our weighted-average remaining term was approximately six years, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants' option, currently representing approximately $40 billion of expected future cash inflows.•Majority of our revenues from large wireless carriers 27◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately three-fourths of our site rental revenues were derived from T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our largest customers.•Majority of land under our towers under long-term control ◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our towers site rental gross margin and approximately 80% of our towers site rental gross margin was derived from towers located on land that we own or control for greater than 10 and 20 years, respectively. The aforementioned percentages include towers located on land that is owned, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, which represented approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin.•Majority of our fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas and are on public rights-of-way •Minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements ◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately 1% of net revenues. •Debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the vast majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our debt)◦As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due January 2028 (\"January 2023 Senior Notes\") and the use of proceeds therefrom, our outstanding debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and weighted average maturity of approximately eight years (assuming anticipated repayment dates where applicable).◦As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, 87% of our debt has fixed rate coupons.◦Our debt service coverage and leverage ratios are within their respective financial maintenance covenants. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.•During 2022, we refinanced and extended the maturities of certain of our debt (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities\" for further discussion of our debt transactions)•Significant cash flows from operations ◦Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022,◦In addition to the positive impact of contractual escalators, we expect to grow our core business of providing access to our communications infrastructure as a result of future anticipated additional demand for our communications infrastructure. Common Stock DividendIn the aggregate, we paid approximately $2.6 billion in common stock dividends during 2022. During each of the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, totaling approximately $1.9 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $1.565 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 6.5% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2022. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our growth in cash flows. Any future common stock dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.Outlook HighlightsThe following are certain highlights of our outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above.•We expect that, when compared to full year 2022, our full year 2023 site rental revenues growth will be positively impacted by tenant additions as large wireless carriers and fiber solutions tenants continue to focus on meeting the increasing demand for data.•We expect to continue to invest a significant amount of our available capital in the form of discretionary capital expenditures for 2023 based on the anticipated returns on such discretionary investments.◦We expect that our discretionary capital expenditures will increase as we accelerate the pace of small cell deployments.•We also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2% of net revenues for full year 2023, consistent with historical annual levels.28Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021 should be read in conjunction with \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and our consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 that is not included in this 2022 Form 10-K, see \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022.The following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts (see \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). See \"Item 7.

MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Non-GAAP and Segment Financial Measures.\"292022 and 2021 Total site rental revenues for 2022 grew by $570 million, or 10%, from 2021. This increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below: (In millions of dollars) (a)Represents site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of the impacts from both straight-line accounting and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP.(b)Represents the contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions.(c)Prepaid rent amortization includes amortization of upfront payments received from long-term tenants and other deferred credits.Towers site rental revenues for 2022 were $4.3 billion and increased by $518 million, or 14%, from $3.8 billion during 2021. The increase in Towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, escalators and non-renewals of tenant contracts. Tenant additions were influenced by our tenants' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.Fiber site rental revenues for 2022 were $2.0 billion and increased by $52 million, or 3%, from $1.9 billion during 2021. The increase in Fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions. Increased demand for small cells was driven by our tenants' network strategy in an effort to provide capacity and relieve network congestion, and increased demand for fiber solutions was driven by increasing demand for data.The increase in Towers site rental gross margin from 2021 to 2022 was related to the previously-mentioned 14% increase in Towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. The increase in Fiber site rental gross margin was predominately related to the previously-mentioned 3% increase in Fiber site rental revenues.Towers services and other gross margin for 2022 was $238 million and increased by $51 million, or 27%, from $187 million during 2021, which is a reflection of the increased volume of activity from carriers' network enhancements and the volume and mix of services and other work. Revenues from our services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term tenant contracts.Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2022 were $750 million and increased by $70 million, or 10%, from $680 million during 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our business and certain costs, including travel and facilities, returning to their pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels following our return to office in February 2022.30Towers operating profit for 2022 increased by $532 million, or 18%, from 2021. The increase in Towers operating profit was primarily related to the previously-mentioned increases in Towers site rental gross margin and Towers services and other gross margin.Fiber operating profit for 2022 increased by $19 million, or 2%, from 2021. The increase in Fiber operating profit was primarily related to the previously-mentioned increase in Fiber site rental gross margin.Depreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.7 billion for 2022 and increased by $63 million, or 4%, from 2021. This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were $699 million for 2022 and increased by $42 million, or 6%, from $657 million during 2021. The increase predominately resulted from an increase in the interest rates on the 2016 Term Loan A, 2016 Revolver and outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, as well as an increase in our outstanding indebtedness due to the financing of our discretionary capital expenditures. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our debt and interest rate increases.As a result of repaying certain of our indebtedness in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses on retirement of long-term obligations of $28 million and $145 million for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.The provisions for income taxes for 2022 and 2021 were $16 million and $21 million, respectively. For both 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Income from continuing operations was $1.7 billion during 2022 compared to $1.2 billion during 2021. The increase was related to (1) growth in our site rental activities in both our Towers and Fiber segments, (2) the previously-mentioned increase in Towers services activity and (3) the decrease in losses of retirement of long-term obligations, partially offset by an increase in expenses, including (1) selling, general and administrative expenses, (2) depreciation, amortization and accretion and (3) interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs.Net income attributable to CCI stockholders increased by $579 million, or 53%, from 2021 to 2022. The increase was due to the previously-mentioned increase in income from continuing operations.Adjusted EBITDA increased by $524 million, or 14%, from 2021 to 2022. The increase was predominately related to the growth in our site rental activities in both our Towers and Fiber segments as well as the previously-mentioned increase in Towers service activity.31Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewGeneral. Our core business generates revenues under long-term tenant contracts (see \"Item 1. Business—Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Overview\") from (1) the largest U.S. wireless carriers and (2) fiber solutions tenants. As a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends, and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. See \"Item 1. Business—Strategy\" for a further discussion of our strategy. We have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. Our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): constructing communications infrastructure, acquiring communications infrastructure, acquiring land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers), improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure, purchasing shares of our common stock, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. We have recently spent, and expect to continue to spend, a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of small cells and fiber. We seek to fund our discretionary investments with both cash generated by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our availability under our 2016 Revolver, issuances under our CP Program, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity-related securities, including under our 2021 ATM Program. We seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital. We target a leverage ratio of approximately five times Adjusted EBITDA, subject to various factors, such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments. We may choose to increase or decrease our leverage from this target for various periods of time. Our contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of (1) Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, (2) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.150% senior unsecured notes (\"3.150% Senior Notes\") and (3) principal payments on certain outstanding debt.We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our REIT status and our NOLs. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Liquidity Position. The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt as well as note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our 2021 ATM Program.(In millions of dollars)Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(a)$327 Undrawn 2016 Revolver availability(b)6,649 Total debt and other obligations (current and non-current)21,729 Total equity7,449   (a)Inclusive of $5 million included within \"Other assets, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet.(b)Availability at any point in time is subject to certain restrictions based on the maintenance of financial covenants contained in our 2016 Credit Facility. At any point in time, we intend to maintain available commitments under our 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of outstanding Commercial Paper Notes. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.Over the next 12 months: •Our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) cash generated by our operating activities, (3) availability under our 2016 Revolver, (4) issuances under our CP Program, and (5) issuances of equity pursuant to our 2021 ATM Program. Our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt obligations of $2.1 billion (consisting of Commercial Paper Notes, the 3.150% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt), (2) cumulative common stock dividend payments expected to be at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion (see \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend\"), and (3) capital expenditures. We may also purchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, amounts available under our CP 32Program may be repaid and re-issued from time to time. During the next 12 months, while our liquidity uses are expected to exceed our cash generated by operating activities, we expect that our liquidity sources described above should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. Historically, from time to time, we have accessed the capital markets to issue debt and equity.•See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a discussion of interest rate risk and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities of $89 million for 2022 from 2021 was due primarily to growth in our core business, which was partially offset by a net decrease from changes in working capital. Changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants. We expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of changes in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.Investing Activities. Net cash used for investing activities for 2022 increased by $20 million from 2021 primarily as a result of increased discretionary capital expenditures in our Fiber segment. Our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining as described below. •Discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. The expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically varies based on, among other factors: (1) the type of communications infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. Currently, construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber (including certain construction projects that may take 18 to 36 months to complete). Our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.•Sustaining capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.33A summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows:For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021December 31, 2020(In millions of dollars)TowersFiberOtherTotalTowersFiberOtherTotalTowersFiberOtherTotalDiscretionary:Communications infrastructure improvements and other capital projects(a)$121 $1,017 $24 $1,162 $138 $905 $33 $1,076 $257 $1,179 $38 $1,474 Purchases of land interests53 — — 53 64 2 — 66 64 — — 64 Sustaining11 41 43 95 19 49 19 87 14 53 19 86 Total$185 $1,058 $67 $1,310 $221 $956 $52 $1,229 $335 $1,232 $57 $1,624  (a)Towers segment includes $48 million, $65 million and $113 million of capital expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with tenant installations and upgrades on our towers.Capital expenditures increased from 2021 to 2022 and were primarily impacted by the previously-mentioned increased discretionary capital expenditures in our Fiber segment. See \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Outlook Highlights\" for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2023 capital expenditures.Financing Activities. We seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities such as (in no particular order): (1) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total at least $6.26 per share over the next 12 months, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion), (2) purchasing our common stock or (3) purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. See \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview\" and notes 7, 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2022, our financing activities predominately related to the following:•paying an aggregate of $2.6 billion in dividends on our common stock;•issuing $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our CP Program and pay related fees and expenses;•prepaying in full the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1;•redeeming in full the previously outstanding 3.849% Secured Notes;•entering into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date from June 2026 to July 2027, (2) an increase to the aggregate commitments under the 2016 Revolver from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion, (3) certain modifications to a specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with the Term SOFR pricing benchmark; and•increasing the size of our CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 billion at any time outstanding.In 2021, our financing activities predominately related to the following:•paying an aggregate of $2.4 billion in dividends on our common stock;•issuing $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to (1) redeem all of the outstanding 5.250% Senior Notes, (2) repay a portion of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes and (3) repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan A; •issuing $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to (1) to repay in full the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class C-2022, (2) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the CP Program and (3) for general corporate purposes; and•entering into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date from June 2024 to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets and increases to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee.Incurrences, Purchases and Repayments of Debt. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview—Liquidity Position\" for further discussion of our recent issuances, purchases, redemptions and repayments of debt.34Common Stock. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our common stock as well as dividends declared and paid. ATM Program. In March 2021, we established the 2021 ATM Program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million. Sales under the 2021 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. See also note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our 2021 ATM Program. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. In July and August 2020, all of our approximately 2 million shares of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into approximately 14 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of our common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 8.8043 shares of common stock for each share of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the July and August conversions into shares of our common stock.Credit Facility. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our 2016 Credit Facility. As of February 21, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $265 million and $6.7 billion in undrawn availability under our 2016 Revolver. The proceeds of our 2016 Revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.Commercial Paper Program. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our CP Program. As of February 21, 2023, there was $1.2 billion outstanding under our CP Program. The proceeds from our Commercial Paper Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.Restricted Cash. Pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Material Cash RequirementsThe following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. These material cash requirements relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. The debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnote (b)). 35(In millions of dollars)Years Ending December 31,Material Cash Requirements20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalsDebt and other long-term obligations(a)$2,060 $831 $593 $2,771 $3,558 $12,078 $21,891 Interest payments on debt and other long-term obligations(b)(c)734 690 670 640 541 5,613 8,888 Lease obligations(d)568 561 545 538 531 5,660 8,403 Total material cash requirements$3,362 $2,082 $1,808 $3,949 $4,630 $23,351 $39,182  (a)The impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 (collectively, \"Tower Revenue Notes\") is not considered. The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the Tower Revenue Notes.(b)If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2022 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $1.0 billion. We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.(c)Includes the unused commitment fees on our 2016 Credit Facility. Interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds. Each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a discussion of our interest rate risk.(d)Amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations. See also the table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.The following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms exercisable at our option, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 36 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of retaining the rights to land under our towers. (a)Inclusive of fee interests and perpetual easements.(b)For the three months ended December 31, 2022, without consideration of the term of the tenant contract.36Debt CovenantsOur 2016 Credit Agreement contains financial maintenance covenants. We are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and, based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of compliance with our debt covenants.

In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by GAAP. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. The critical accounting policies and estimates for 2022 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Lease Accounting—Lessee. For our Towers segment, our lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under our towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site and are generally for an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at our option. We also enter into term easements and ground leases in which we prepay the entire term. For our Fiber segment, our lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to facilitate our small cells and fiber solutions. The majority of our lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at our option. We include certain renewal option periods in the lease term when we determine that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. For both our Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expense is recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require us to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of our ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, we consider all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. We calculate the straight-line expense over the contract's estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that we deem reasonably certain to be exercised.We recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset (and, as applicable, a corresponding lease liability) for each of our operating leases. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term, and lease liabilities represent the present value of our future lease payments. In assessing our leases and determining our lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, we are not able to readily determine the rate implicit for our lessee arrangements and thus use our incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of our lease payments. Our ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs.We review the carrying value of our ROU assets for impairment, similar to our other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of our ROU assets.Revenue Recognition. 90% of our total revenue for 2022 consisted of site rental revenues, which are recognized on a ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from fiber solutions tenants, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of our tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant's option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant's option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element (such as an escalator tied to an inflation-based index) in addition to a minimum. To the extent we acquire below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure (for example with respect to small cells and fiber), we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term. Since we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the site rental revenues in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods. Our assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are 38deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which we have an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the consolidated balance sheet.As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, which represented 10% of our total revenues for 2022. Services and other revenues consists predominately of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). Our services generally have a duration of one year or less. Upon contract commencement, we assess our services to tenants and identify performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.We may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of the above performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which we believe we have transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price.The transaction price for tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to our towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under our tower installation services agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a ratable basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the tower installation service, we have one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues.Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet.Accounting for Acquisitions—General. The majority of our towers have been acquired directly or indirectly from the three largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999. We evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. For our business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Accounting for Acquisitions—Valuation\" below. The determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized. Such changes could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Acquisitions—Leases. With respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases. The evaluation of such agreements for finance or operating lease treatment previously included consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under ASC 840-10-25, namely (1) the transfer of ownership provisions, (2) the existence of bargain purchase options, (3) the length of the remaining lease term, and (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments. With respect to the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we determined that the tower leases were finance leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion, after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under ASC 840-10-25 to leases involving both land and buildings (i.e., towers). We determined that the fragmentation criteria was met, and the tower leases could be accounted for as finance leases apart from the land leases, which are accounted for as operating leases, since (1) the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25% of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and (2) the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75% of the estimated economic life of the tower assets.Accounting for Acquisitions—Valuation. As of December 31, 2022, our largest asset was property and equipment (which primarily consists of communications infrastructure) followed by goodwill, operating lease ROU assets and intangible assets. Our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets.39The fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either:(1)discounted cash flow valuation methods (for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and tenant relationships or operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities acquired); or(2)estimates of replacement costs (for tangible fixed assets such as communications infrastructure).The purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements, including the amount of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. The most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are (1) the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and (2) the economic useful life after giving effect to age, quality, and condition. The most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are (1) discount rates and (2) timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding tenant renewals and cancellations. The most important estimates for measurement of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities acquired are (1) present value of our future lease payments, including whether renewals or extensions should be measured, and (2) favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms. With respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options.We record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements, pursuant to our ground leases, easements, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which certain of our communications infrastructure resides. In determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to: (1) timing of cash flows, (2) future costs, (3) discount rates and (4) the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land. We do not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to our fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets—Useful Lives. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization and accretion expense that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. A substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure, the majority of which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewals).The useful lives of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. We review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure.Accounting for Long-Lived Assets—Impairment Evaluation. We review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For purposes of our Towers segment, we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets:(1)we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups; and(2)we separately pool the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate.40We first pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing, because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio. We re-evaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually. This use of grouping is based in part on (1) our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure, (2) the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios, and (3) the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace. The vast majority of our site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the U.S. owned communications infrastructure group. Secondly, and separately, we pool the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate, for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related tenant relationships acquired.For purposes of our Fiber segment, we consider major U.S. markets where we have made significant investments to be the most appropriate level for purposes of grouping our long-lived assets for potential impairment evaluation.Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset. When considering the utility of our assets, we consider events that would meaningfully impact (1) our communications infrastructure or (2) our tenant relationships. For example, consideration would be given to events that impact (1) the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or (2) our ability to derive benefit from our existing tenant relationships, including events such as tenant's bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant tenant. During 2022, there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations.If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset group is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. If the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. The most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are (1) the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and (2) estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of tenant contracts. We could record impairments in the future if changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets, or if we changed our unit of account in the future.Approximately 2% of our total towers currently have no tenants. We continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future, primarily because of the demographics and continuing increase in demand for data in the areas around these individual towers. We estimate, based on current visibility, potential tenants on a majority of these towers. To the extent we do not believe there are long-term prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value have been exhausted, including sale of the asset, we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value.Accounting for Goodwill—Impairment Evaluation. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. We then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would be required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments (Towers and Fiber). See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairments.Deferred Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our REIT taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining NOLs. Accordingly, the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to TRSs. Furthermore, as a result of the deduction for dividends paid, some or all of our NOLs related to our REIT may expire without utilization. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" for a discussion of the impact of our REIT status. 41Our TRSs will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance, which would reduce our earnings. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. The change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows. For a further discussion of our benefit (provision) for income taxes, see \"Item 7. MD&A—Results of Operations\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP and Segment Financial MeasuresIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein and as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, we also provide (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate the performance of our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. We define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. We define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.We use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of consolidated financial performance. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other REITs, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss), net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. There are material limitations to using a measure such as Adjusted EBITDA, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. Management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, stock-based compensation expense and net (gain) loss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) is set forth below: 42Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars)202220212020Net income (loss)$1,675 $1,096 $1,056 Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):Asset write-down charges34 21 74 Acquisition and integration costs2 1 10 Depreciation, amortization and accretion1,707 1,644 1,608 Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments16 18 18 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs699 657 689 (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations28 145 95 Interest income(3)(1)(2)Other (income) expense10 21 5 (Benefit) provision for income taxes16 21 20 Stock-based compensation expense156 131 133 Net (gain) loss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax— 62 — Adjusted EBITDA(a)$4,340 $3,816 $3,706  (a)The above reconciliation excludes the items included in our Adjusted EBITDA definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because:•it is the primary measure used by our management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations; •although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; •we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results; and •it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:•as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation; •as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results; •in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management; •for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget; •as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets; •in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio; and •with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios that incorporate concepts such as, or similar to, Adjusted EBITDA. 43Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no interest rate swaps.Our interest rate risk as of December 31, 2022 relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom: •the potential refinancing of our $21.9 billion in existing debt, compared to $20.8 billion in the prior year;•our $2.7 billion of floating rate debt, compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year, representing approximately 13% and 10% of total debt, respectively; and•potential future borrowings of incremental debt, including borrowings under our 2016 Credit Facility and issuances under our CP Program.Over the past 11 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate eight times for a cumulative increase of 4.50% and has signaled further increases in the near-term, which could further increase our costs of borrowing. Prior to 2022, the Federal Reserve had not raised the federal funds rate since December 2018. See also \"Item 1a. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of risks stemming from interest rate increases.Potential Refinancing of Existing DebtOur contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, the 3.150% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt. See below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of December 31, 2022.Floating Rate DebtWe manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom, we had $2.7 billion of floating rate debt. A hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing floating rate debt of 1/4 of a percent point over a 12-month period would increase our interest expense by approximately $7 million.Potential Future Borrowings of Incremental DebtWe typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" regarding our liquidity strategy.44The following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates. The future principal payments and weighted-average interest rates are presented as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. These debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates, and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnotes (b) and (d)). See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt. Future Principal Payments and Interest Rates by the Debt Instruments' Contractual Year of Maturity(In millions of dollars)20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalFair Value(a)Fixed rate debt(b)$789 $786 $532 $2,680 $2,277 $12,078 $19,142 $15,816 Average interest rate(b)(c)(d)3.2 %3.3 %1.5 %3.0 %3.5 %4.1 %3.7 %Variable rate debt(e)$1,271 (f)$45 $60 $91 $1,281 $— $2,748 $3,738 Average interest rate(e)5.2 %4.8 %4.0 %4.0 %4.0 %— %4.6 % (a)The fair value of our debt is based on indicative quotes, non-binding quotes from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask offers.

The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and Series 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. (c)The average interest rate represents the weighted-average stated coupon rate (see also footnote (d)).(d)    If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.47Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Towers SegmentAs described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $4,322 million in site rental revenues and $685 million in services and other revenues from its Towers segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, noncancelable term of the relevant tenant contract. The Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (i) site development services and (ii) installation services. The transaction price for the Company's tower installation services consists of amounts for (i) permanent improvements to the Company's towers that represent a lease component and (ii) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company's tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for the Towers segment is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to tenant contracts and installation service agreements. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to revenue recognition for Towers. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification of the contractual terms by examining tenant contracts and installation service agreements on a test basis and (ii) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on contractual terms and estimated lease term for selected tenant contracts and installation service agreements./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaFebruary 24, 2023We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2011.48CROWN CASTLE INC.

(formerly, Crown Castle International Corp.) and its predecessor, as applicable (together, \"CCI\"), and their subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as the \"Company.\" All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As used herein, the term \"including,\" and any variation thereof, means \"including without limitation.\" The use of the word \"or\" herein is not exclusive. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to \"U.S.\" are to the United States of America and Puerto Rico, collectively.The Company owns, operates and leases shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., including (1) towers and other structures, such as rooftops (collectively, \"towers\"), and (2) fiber primarily supporting small cell networks (\"small cells\") and fiber solutions. The Company's towers, small cells and fiber assets are collectively referred to herein as \"communications infrastructure,\" and the Company's customers on its communications infrastructure are referred to herein as \"tenants.\" The Company's core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). The Company's operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. See note 14.Approximately 53% of the Company's towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). The Company has the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See notes 4 and 13.As part of the Company's effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). The Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Company has certain taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"). See note 9.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe following is a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies in effect for the year ended December 31, 2022.Restricted CashRestricted cash represents (1) the cash held in reserve by the indenture trustees pursuant to the indenture governing certain of the Company's debt instruments, (2) cash securing performance obligations such as letters of credit, as well as (3) any other cash whose use is limited by contractual provisions. The restriction of rental cash receipts is a critical feature of certain of the Company's debt instruments, due to the applicable indenture trustee's ability to utilize the restricted cash for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, (3) real estate or personal property taxes, (4) insurance premiums related to towers, (5) other assessments by governmental authorities and potential environmental remediation costs, or (6) a portion of advance rents from tenants. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See note 16 for a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.53NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Receivables AllowanceAn allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable. The Company uses judgment in estimating this allowance and considers historical collections, current credit status, or contractual provisions. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged either to \"Site rental costs of operations\" or to \"Services and other costs of operations,\" as appropriate, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible.Lease AccountingGeneral. The Company evaluates whether a contract meets the definition of a lease whenever a contract grants a party the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To the extent the identified asset is able to be shared among multiple parties, the Company has determined that one party does not have control of the identified asset and the contract is not considered a lease. The Company accounts for contracts that do not meet the definition of a lease under other relevant accounting guidance (such as ASC 606 for revenue from contracts with customers).Lessee. For its Tower segment, the Company's lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site, generally contain an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at the Company's option. The Company also enters into term easements and ground leases in which it prepays the entire term. For its Fiber segment, the Company's lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to support the Company's small cells and fiber solutions.The majority of the Company's lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at the Company's option. The Company includes renewal option periods in its calculation of the estimated lease term when it determines the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. When such renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain, the estimated lease term determined under ASC 842 will be greater than the non-cancelable term of the contractual arrangement. Although certain renewal periods are included in the estimated lease term, the Company would have the ability to terminate or elect to not renew a particular lease if business conditions warrant such a decision.The Company classifies its lessee arrangements at inception as either operating leases or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the five criteria described above for finance lease classification is met. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets associated with operating leases are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Current and long-term portions of lease liabilities related to operating leases are included in \"Current portion of operating lease liabilities\" and \"Operating lease liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, respectively. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's present value of its future lease payments. In assessing its leases and determining its lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, the Company is not able to readily determine the rate implicit for its lessee arrangements, and thus uses its incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company's ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs. For both the Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company's ground lease and fiber lease agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company calculates the straight-line expense over the contract's estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that the Company deems reasonably certain to be exercised.Lease agreements may also contain provisions for a contingent payment based on (1) the revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset, (2) the change in CPI or (3) the usage of the leased asset. The Company's contingent payments are considered variable lease payments and are (1) not included in the initial measurement of 54NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)the ROU asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and (2) recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.ROU assets associated with finance leases are included in \"Property and equipment, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities associated with finance leases are included in \"Current maturities of debt and other obligations\" and \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. For both its Towers and Fiber segments, the Company measures the lease liability for finance leases using the effective interest method. The initial lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the liability and decreased to reflect payments made during the period. Interest on the lease liability is determined each period during the lease term as the amount that results in a constant periodic discount rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The Company depreciates ROU assets for finance leases on a ratable basis over the applicable lease term.The Company reviews the carrying value of its ROU assets for impairment, similar to its other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of its ROU assets.Lessor. The Company's lessor arrangements primarily include tenant contracts for dedicated space (including dedicated fiber) on its shared communications infrastructure. The Company classifies its leases at inception as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. A lease is classified as a sales-type lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying assets or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. Furthermore, when none of the above criteria is met, a lease is classified as a direct financing lease if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the present value of the of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee, that is not already reflected in the lease payments, equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying asset and (2) it is probable that the lessor will collect the lease payments plus any amount necessary to satisfy a residual value guarantee. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not qualify as a sales-type or direct financing lease. Currently, the Company classifies all of its lessor arrangements as operating leases.Site rental revenues from the Company’s lessor arrangements are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating straight-line site rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions. Certain of the Company's arrangements with tenants in its Fiber segment contain both lease and non-lease components. In such circumstances, the Company has determined (1) the timing and pattern of transfer for the lease and non-lease component are the same and (2) the stand-alone lease component would be classified as an operating lease. As such, the Company has aggregated certain non-lease components with lease components and has determined that the lease components (generally dedicated fiber) represent the predominant component of the arrangement.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment includes land owned in fee and perpetual easements for land, which have no definite life. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Depreciation for the majority of communications infrastructure is computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewal periods). Additions and permanent improvements to the Company's communications infrastructure are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed.Labor and interest costs incurred directly related to the construction of certain property and equipment are capitalized during the construction phase of projects. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $265 million, $238 million and $270 million in capitalized labor costs, respectively. The carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.55NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Abandonments and write-offs of property and equipment are recorded to \"Asset write-down charges\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and were $39 million, $19 million and $77 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Asset write-down charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the write-off of property and equipment of approximately $63 million which, following the 2020 Cancellation, was deemed to have no alternative future use. See note 15 for further information regarding the 2020 Cancellation.Asset Retirement ObligationsPursuant to its ground lease, easement, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, the Company records obligations to perform asset retirement activities, including requirements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space on which certain of its communications infrastructure is located. The Company does not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to its fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Asset retirement obligations are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The liability accretes as a result of the passage of time and the related accretion expense is included in \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as an additional carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of such asset.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price for an acquired business over the allocated value of the related net assets. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. The Company's reporting units are the same as its operating segments (Towers and Fiber). The Company then performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairments.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are included in \"Site rental contracts and tenant relationships, net\" and \"Other intangible assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and predominately consist of the estimated fair value of site rental contracts and tenant relationships or other contractual rights, such as trademarks, that are recorded in conjunction with acquisitions. Site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are comprised of (1) the current term of the existing leases, (2) the high rate of tenant retention, and (3) any associated relationships that are expected to generate value following the expiration of all renewal periods under existing leases. The useful lives of intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit the Company and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships, which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite useful lives will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company has a dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets. First, the Company pools site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets with the related communications infrastructure assets into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for 56NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)impairment testing. Second and separately, the Company pools the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate. If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset.Deferred CreditsDeferred credits are included in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and consist of the estimated fair value of below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on acquired communications infrastructure that are amortized to site rental revenues.Fair value for these deferred credits represents the difference between (1) the stated contractual payments to be made pursuant to the in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding lease. Deferred credits are measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining economic lease term considering renewal provisions or economics associated with those renewal provisions, to the extent applicable. Deferred credits are amortized over their respected estimated lease terms at the time of acquisition.Deferred Financing CostsThird-party costs incurred to obtain financing, with the exception of costs incurred related to revolving lines of credit, are deferred and are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability in \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the related debt liability. Third party costs incurred to obtain financing through a revolving line of credit are deferred and are included in \"Other assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement (as defined in note 7).Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Typically, providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site Rental Revenues. Site rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, which generally ranges from five to 15 years for wireless tenants and three to 20 years for the Company's fiber solutions tenants (including from organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of the tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant's option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant's option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating straight-line rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.Services and Other Revenues. As part of the Company’s effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. Upon contract commencement, the Company assesses its services to tenants and identifies performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.57NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The Company may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of these performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which the Company believes it has transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price. The volume and mix of site development services may vary among contracts and may include a combination of some or all of the above performance obligations. Payments generally are due within 45 to 60 days and generally do not contain variable-consideration provisions. The transaction price for the Company's tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to the Company's towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company's tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues on the Company consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of the Company’s services generally have a duration of one year or less.Additional Information on Revenues. As of January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, a total of $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of unrecognized revenue was reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $668 million of the January 1, 2022 unrecognized revenue balance was recognized as revenue. As of January 1, 2021, a total of $2.8 billion of unrecognized revenue was reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately $595 million of the January 1, 2021 unrecognized revenue balance was recognized as revenue.See note 3 for further discussion regarding the Company’s revenues.Costs of OperationsApproximately half of the Company's site rental costs of operations expenses consist of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses, property taxes, repairs and maintenance expenses, employee compensation or related benefit costs, or utilities. Generally, the ground leases for land are specific to each site and are for an initial term of five years and are renewable for pre-determined periods. The Company also enters into term easements and ground leases in which it prepays the entire term in advance. Fiber access expenses primarily consist of leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate the Company's communications infrastructure. Ground lease and fiber access expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company's ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, the Company considers all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's liability related to straight-line expense is included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company's assets related to prepaid agreements is included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.Services and other costs of operations predominately consist of third-party service providers such as contractors and professional services firms and, to a lesser extent, internal labor costs, associated with the Company's site development and installation services. The Company's costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of associated performance obligations of $43 million and $65 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.The Company recognized $20 million as costs of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a reduction in staffing completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Such costs were comprised of employee severance payments and termination benefits and primarily impacted the Company's Fiber segment.58NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Acquisitions and Integration CostsDirect or incremental costs related to a potential or completed business combination transaction are expensed as incurred. Such costs are predominately comprised of severance, retention bonuses payable to employees of an acquired enterprise, temporary employees to assist with the integration of the acquired operations, fees paid for services (such as consulting, accounting, legal, or engineering reviews), and any other costs directly associated with the transaction. These business combination costs are included in \"Acquisition and integration costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For those transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.Stock-based CompensationRestricted Stock Units. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for unvested restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of RSUs for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered is recognized in the period of the change in the estimate. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the awards vest. A discussion of the Company's valuation techniques and related assumptions and estimates used to measure the Company's stock-based compensation is as follows:Valuation. The fair value of RSUs without market conditions is determined based on the number of shares relating to such RSUs and the quoted price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs with market conditions granted using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Company's determination of the fair value of RSUs with market conditions on the date of grant is affected by its common stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex or subjective variables. The determination of fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation requires the input of subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results.Amortization Method. The Company amortizes the fair value of all RSUs on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting tranche of the award (graded vesting schedule) over the requisite service periods. Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock.Expected Dividend Rate. The expected dividend rate at the date of grant is based on the then-current dividend yield.Risk-Free Rate. The Company bases the risk-free rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.Forfeitures. The Company uses historical award forfeiture data and management's judgment about the future employee turnover rates to estimate the number of shares for which the requisite service period will not be rendered.Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing CostsThe components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Interest expense on debt obligations$685 $644 $683 Amortization of deferred financing costs and adjustments on long-term debt26 25 23 Capitalized interest(12)(12)(17)Total$699 $657 $689 The Company amortizes deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums over the estimated term of the related borrowing using the effective interest yield method. Deferred financing costs and discounts are generally presented as a direct reduction to the related debt obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 59NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Income TaxesThe Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its net taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders. The Company also may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income and (2) taxes related to the TRSs. In addition, the Company could under certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. Additionally, the Company has included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located. The Company's foreign assets and operations (including its tower operations in Puerto Rico) are subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether they are included in a TRS or not. For its REIT conversion and certain subsequent acquisitions into the REIT, the Company will be subject to a federal corporate level tax rate (currently 21%) on any gain recognized from the sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally 5 years) after the transfer date up to the amount of the built in gain that existed on the transfer date, which is based upon the fair market value of those assets in excess of the Company's tax basis on the transfer date. This gain can be offset by any remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\").For the Company's TRSs, the Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that the asset will not be realized. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets each quarter and based upon projections of future taxable income, reversing deferred tax liabilities or other known events that are expected to affect future taxable income, records a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the \"more likely than not\" realization threshold. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based upon changes in facts and circumstances that impact the recoverability of the asset.The Company recognizes a tax position if it is \"more likely than not\" that it will be sustained upon examination. The tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the benefit (provision) for income taxes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not recorded any material penalties related to its income tax positions. See note 9.Per Share InformationBasic net income (loss), per common share, excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, diluted net income (loss), per common share, is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus any potential dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units as determined under the treasury stock method and (2) conversion of the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (\"6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock\"), as applicable, as determined under the if-converted method.60NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations is shown in the table below.  Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,675 $1,158 $1,056 Dividends/distributions on preferred stock— — (57)Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to CCI common stockholders for basic and diluted computations$1,675 $1,158 $999 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$— $(62)$— Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders$1,675 $1,096 $999 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (in millions):Basic weighted-average number of common stock outstanding433 432 423 Effect of assumed dilution from potential issuance of common shares relating to RSUs1 2 2 Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding434 434 425 Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders, per common share:Income (loss) from continuing operations, basic$3.87 $2.68 $2.36 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, basic— (0.14)— Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders—basic$3.87 $2.54 $2.36 Income (loss) from continuing operations, diluted$3.86 $2.67 $2.35 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, diluted— (0.14)— Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders—diluted$3.86 $2.53 $2.35 Dividends/distributions declared per share of common stock$5.98 $5.46 $4.93 For the year ended December 31, 2020, 14 million common share equivalents related to the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock were excluded from the dilutive common shares, because the impact of the conversion of such preferred stock would be anti-dilutive based on the Company's common stock price at the end of each respective year. See note 10 for further discussion of the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock. Fair ValuesThe Company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are (1) Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active and accessible markets, (2) Level 2 — observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data, and (3) Level 3 — unobservable inputs and are not corroborated by market data. The Company evaluates fair value hierarchy level classifications quarterly, and transfers between levels are effective at the end of the quarterly period.The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate the carrying values. The Company determines the fair value of its debt securities based on indicative, non-binding quotes from brokers. Quotes from brokers require judgment and are based on the brokers' interpretation of market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices or quotes from active markets if available. There were no changes since December 31, 2021 in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair values. See note 8 for a further discussion of fair values. 61NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsNo accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2022 had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedNo new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted are expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.3.RevenuesThe following table is a summary of the contracted amounts owed to the Company by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022.

The Company has the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.62NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 31% of the Company's towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). Approximately half of such towers have an initial term of 32 years (through May 2037), and the Company has the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of such leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile for approximately $2.3 billion. The remainder of such towers have a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin, and the Company has the option to purchase such towers from T-Mobile at the end of the respective terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. In addition, another 1% of the Company's towers under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with T-Mobile are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with AT&T. The Company has the option to purchase these towers from AT&T at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due prior to 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).See note 13 for further discussion of finance leases recorded as \"Property and equipment, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.5.Goodwill and Intangible Assets GoodwillThe carrying value of goodwill was $10.1 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, the Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively.(c)The Company's finance leases and other obligations relate to land, fiber, vehicles, and other assets and bear interest rates ranging up to 10% and mature in periods ranging from less than one year to approximately 25 years.(d)As of December 31, 2022, the undrawn availability under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility (\"2016 Revolver\") was $5.7 billion.(e)Both the 2016 Revolver and senior unsecured term loan A facility (\"2016 Term Loan A\" and, collectively, \"2016 Credit Facility\") bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (1) Term SOFR plus (i) a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum and (ii) a credit spread ranging from 0.875% to 1.750% per annum or (2) an alternate base rate plus a credit spread ranging from 0.000% to 0.750% per annum, in each case, with the applicable credit spread based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating.

See further discussion below regarding potential adjustments to such percentages.(f)The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes, as defined below, when outstanding, may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance.65NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The credit agreement governing the Company's 2016 Credit Facility (\"2016 Credit Agreement\") contains financial maintenance covenants. The Company is currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants, and based upon current expectations, the Company believes it will continue to comply with its financial maintenance covenants. In addition, certain of the Company's debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on CCI or its subsidiaries and may limit the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase the Company's securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow.Bank Debt2016 Credit Facility. In January 2016, the Company established the 2016 Credit Facility, which was originally comprised of (1) a $2.5 billion 2016 Revolver maturing in January 2021, (2) a $2.0 billion 2016 Term Loan A maturing in January 2021 and (3) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility (\"364-Day Facility\") maturing in January 2017. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 Credit Facility (1) to repay the then outstanding senior credit facility originally established in January 2012 and (2) for general corporate purposes. In February 2016, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the February 2016 Senior Notes (as defined below) offering to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the then outstanding 364-Day Facility. In February 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and (2) extend the maturity of both the 2016 Term Loan A and the 2016 Revolver to January 2022. In August 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $3.5 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to August 2022.In June 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $4.25 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2023. In June 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $5.0 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2024.In June 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread (\"Spread\") and unused commitment fee (\"Commitment Fee\") percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets (\"Targets\") and increases to the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds (\"Thresholds\") and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to an upward adjustment of up to 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively, if the Company fails to achieve the Thresholds. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to a downward adjustment of up to 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively, if the Company achieves the Targets. In January 2022, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of December 31, 2021, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentages were reduced for 2022.In July 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to July 2027, (2) an increase to the commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $7.0 billion, (3) certain modifications to the specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with a Term SOFR pricing benchmark.In January 2023, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of December 31, 2022, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage reductions applied in January 2022 were maintained for 2023.66NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Commercial Paper Program. In April 2019, the Company established a commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\"). Commercial Paper Notes may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with an aggregate principal amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time originally not to exceed $1.0 billion. The net proceeds of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes, when outstanding, may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper Notes are issued under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, can be issued at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. At any point in time, the Company intends to maintain available commitments under its 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. While any outstanding commercial paper issuances generally have short-term maturities, the Company classifies the outstanding issuances as long-term based on its ability and intent to refinance the outstanding issuances on a long-term basis.In March 2022, the Company increased the size of the CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 billion at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net issuances of $1.2 billion under the CP Program. Securitized DebtThe Tower Revenue Notes and the Secured Notes, Series 2009-1, Class A-2 (\"2009 Securitized Notes\") (collectively, \"Securitized Debt\") are obligations of special purpose entities and their direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an \"issuer\"), all of which are wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of CCI. The Tower Revenue Notes and 2009 Securitized Notes are governed by separate indentures. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes and 2018 Tower Revenue Notes (each as defined below) are governed by one indenture and consist of multiple series of notes, each with its own anticipated repayment date.In May 2015, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2015 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company's then outstanding Tower Revenue Notes. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.222% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2022 and a final maturity date of May 2042 (\"Series 2015-1 Notes\") and (2) $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.663% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2025 and a final maturity date of May 2045 (\"Series 2015-2 Notes\"). The Company primarily used the net proceeds of the 2015 Tower Revenue Notes, together with proceeds received from the Company's sale of the formerly 77.6% owned subsidiary that operated towers in Australia (\"CCAL\"), to (1) repay $250 million aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding August 2010 Tower Revenue Notes, (2) repay all of the then outstanding WCP Secured Wireless Site Contracts Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1 (\"WCP Securitized Notes\"), (3) repay portions of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility and (4) pay related fees and expenses. In June 2021, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2021 Senior Notes (as defined below) offering to repay in whole the Series 2015-1 Notes.In July 2018, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2018 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company's existing Tower Revenue Notes. The 2018 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.720% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2023 and a final maturity of July 2043 (\"Series 2018-1 Notes\") and (2) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.241% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2028 and a final maturity of July 2048 (\"Series 2018-2 Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2010-6 and to pay related fees and expenses. In addition to the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes described above, in connection with Exchange Act risk retention requirements (\"Risk Retention Rules\"), an indirect subsidiary of the Company issued and a majority-owned affiliate of the Company purchased approximately $53 million of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1, Class R-2028 to retain an eligible horizontal residual interest (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes. In March 2022, the Company prepaid the Series 2018-1 Notes.The Securitized Debt is paid solely from the cash flows generated by the operation of the towers held directly and indirectly by the issuers of the respective Securitized Debt. The Securitized Debt is secured by, among other things, (1) a security interest in substantially all of the applicable issuers' assignable personal property, (2) a pledge of the equity interests in each applicable issuer and (3) a security interest in the applicable issuers' leases with tenants to lease tower space (space licenses). The governing instruments of two indirect subsidiaries (\"Crown Atlantic\" and \"Crown GT\") of the issuers of the 67NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Tower Revenue Notes generally prevent them from issuing debt and granting liens on their assets without the approval of a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. Consequently, while distributions paid by Crown Atlantic and Crown GT will service the Tower Revenue Notes, the Tower Revenue Notes are not obligations of, nor are the Tower Revenue Notes secured by the cash flows or any other assets of, Crown Atlantic and Crown GT. As of December 31, 2022, the Securitized Debt was collateralized with personal property and equipment with an aggregate net book value of approximately $813 million, exclusive of Crown Atlantic and Crown GT personal property and equipment.The excess cash flows from the issuers of the Securitized Debt, after the payment of principal, interest, reserves, expenses and management fees, are distributed to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (\"DSCR\") (as defined in the applicable governing loan agreement) as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to a certain level, then all excess cash flow of the issuers of the applicable debt instrument will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Company. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Company until the DSCR exceeds a certain level for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the DSCR falls below a certain level as of the end of any calendar quarter, then all cash on deposit in the reserve account along with future excess cash flows of the issuers will be applied to prepay the debt with applicable prepayment consideration.The Company may repay the Securitized Debt in whole or in part at any time, provided in each case that such prepayment is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration. The Securitized Debt has covenants and restrictions customary for rated securitizations, including provisions prohibiting the issuers from incurring additional indebtedness or further encumbering their assets. Bonds—Senior NotesIn March 2022, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior unsecured notes due March 2027 (\"March 2022 Senior Notes\").

These amounts include approximately $237 million of losses related to stock-based compensation. The Company also has foreign NOLs of $32 million. If not utilized, the Company's U.S. federal NOLs expire starting in 2025 and ending in 2036, the state NOLs started expiring in 2022 and end in 2036, and the foreign NOLs expire starting in 2023 and ending in 2036. The utilization of the NOLs is subject to certain limitations. The Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns generally remain open to examination by taxing authorities until three years after the applicable NOLs have been used or expired.As of December 31, 2022, there were no unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. From time to time, the Company is subject to examinations by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. At this time, the Company is not subject to an Internal Revenue Service examination.On April 26, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement in principle with the Australian Taxation Office (\"ATO\") to pay A$83 million to settle the previously disclosed outstanding audit of the Australian tax consequences of the Company’s 2015 sale of Crown Castle Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (\"CCAL\"), formerly a 77.6% owned Australian subsidiary of the Company (\"ATO Settlement\"). The sale of CCAL generated approximately $1.2 billion in net proceeds to the Company, and resulted in a gain from the disposal of discontinued operations of $979 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.On June 16, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the ATO evidencing the ATO Settlement. On July 1, 2021, the Company paid approximately $62 million (A$83 million), based on the exchange rate in effect on that date, pursuant to the ATO Settlement. The Company recognized the ATO Settlement as a charge within discontinued 72NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)operations in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021, as this amount represented a reduction to the gain from the disposal of discontinued operations previously reported during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company reflected the payment pursuant to the ATO Settlement within discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021.The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it has business operations. The Company has no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company does not believe any such additional assessments arising from other examinations or audits will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.As of December 31, 2022, the Company's deferred tax assets are included in \"Other assets, net\" and the Company's deferred tax liabilities are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 10.Equity2021 \"At-the-Market\" Stock Offering ProgramIn March 2021, the Company established an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program through which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million (\"2021 ATM Program\"). Sales under the 2021 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to the Company's specific instructions, at negotiated prices. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. The Company has not sold any shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program. Convertible Preferred Stock ConversionIn July and August 2020, all of the approximately 2 million shares of the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 14 million shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 8.8043 shares of common stock per each share of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Declaration and Payment of DividendsDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the following dividends/distributions were declared or paid:Equity TypeDeclaration DateRecord DatePayment DateDividends Per ShareAggregate Payment Amount(a)Common StockFebruary 8, 2022March 15, 2022March 31, 2022$1.470 $639 Common StockMay 10, 2022June 15, 2022June 30, 2022$1.470 $638 Common StockJuly 25, 2022September 15, 2022September 30, 2022$1.470 $636 Common StockOctober 20, 2022December 15, 2022December 30, 2022$1.565 $674  (a)Inclusive of dividends accrued for holders of unvested RSUs, which will be paid when and if the RSUs vest.See also note 17 for a discussion of the Company's common stock dividend declared in February 2023.73NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Tax Treatment of DividendsThe following table summarizes, for income tax purposes, the nature of dividends paid during 2022 on the Company's common stock.Equity TypePayment DateCash Distribution (per share)Ordinary Taxable Dividend (per share)Qualified Taxable Dividend (per share)(a)Section 199A Dividend (per share)Non-Taxable Distribution (per share)Common StockMarch 31, 2022$1.470000 $0.965086 $0.015821 $0.949265 $0.504914 Common StockJune 30, 2022$1.470000 $0.965086 $0.015821 $0.949265 $0.504914 Common StockSeptember 30, 2022$1.470000 $0.965086 $0.015821 $0.949265 $0.504914 Common StockDecember 30, 2022$1.565000 $1.027456 $0.016844 $1.010612 $0.537544  (a)Qualified taxable dividend and section 199A dividend amounts are included in ordinary taxable dividend amounts.Purchases of the Company's Common StockDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased 0.4 million, 0.4 million and 0.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, utilizing $65 million, $70 million and $76 million in cash, respectively.11.Stock-based CompensationStock Compensation PlansPursuant to stockholder approved plans, the Company has granted stock-based awards to certain employees, consultants or non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates. Following the stockholder approval of the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"2022 LTIP\"), no further awards can be made under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"2013 LTIP\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 3 million shares available for issuance under existing awards pursuant to the 2013 LTIP and approximately 13 million shares available for issuance under existing and future awards pursuant to the 2022 LTIP. Of the shares remaining available for future issuance, approximately 2 million shares may be issued pursuant to outstanding RSUs granted under the 2013 LTIP.Restricted Stock UnitsThe Company issues RSUs to certain executives and employees. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock subject to satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms. The RSUs granted to certain executives and employees include (1) annual performance awards that generally include provisions for forfeiture by the employee if certain market performance of the Company's common stock (as further described below) is not achieved, (2) new hire or promotional awards that generally contain only service-based vesting conditions and (3) other awards related to specific business initiatives or compensation objectives including retention and merger integration. Generally, such awards vest over periods of approximately three years.The following is a summary of the RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2022. RSUs (In millions)Outstanding at the beginning of year2 Granted1 Vested(1)Forfeited— Outstanding at end of year2 The Company granted approximately one million RSUs to its executives and certain other employees for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of the grants for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $146.52, $155.01 and $160.78 per share, respectively. The weighted-average requisite service period for the RSUs granted during 2022 was approximately 2.3 years.74NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Of the approximately one million RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2022, (1) approximately 0.7 million RSUs were subject to time-based vesting conditions, vesting over a three-year period and (2) approximately 0.4 million RSUs were granted to the Company's executives and certain other employees and may vest on the third anniversary of the grant date based upon (a) the Company's total stockholder returns (defined as share price appreciation plus the value of dividends paid during the performance period) and (b) the Company's total stockholder return compared to that of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Certain RSU agreements contain provisions that result in forfeiture by the employee of any unvested shares in the event that the Company's common stock does not achieve certain performance targets. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the market performance target is achieved. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation to determine the grant-date fair value for the RSUs with market conditions granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.  Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Risk-free rate1.7 %0.2 %1.4 %Expected volatility31 %30 %19 %Expected dividend rate3.0 %3.4 %3.5 %The Company recognized aggregate stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs of $134 million, $110 million and $111 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The explosion resulted in two fatalities, physical injuries (some of which were serious), and property damage to surrounding buildings and businesses. Currently, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an outcome or estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these lawsuits.75NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Other MattersThe Company is involved in various other claims, assessments, lawsuits or proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such other matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs or losses that may be incurred, if any, management believes the adverse resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Additionally, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are contingently liable for commitments or performance guarantees arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain letters of credit or surety bonds. See note 13 for a discussion of operating lease commitments. In addition, see note 4 for a discussion of the Company's option to purchase approximately 53% of its towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options.13.LeasesLessor Tenant LeasesSee note 3 for further information regarding the contractual amounts owed to the Company pursuant to tenant contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022 and other information.Lessee Operating LeasesThe components of the Company's operating lease expense are as follows:Years Ended December 31,202220212020Lease cost:Operating lease expense(a)$660 $646 $640 Variable lease expense(b)175 164 153 Total lease expense(c)$835 $810 $793  (a)Represents the Company's operating lease expense related to its ROU assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.(b)Represents the Company's expense related to contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Such contingencies are recognized as expense in the period they are resolved.(c)Excludes those direct operating expenses accounted for pursuant to accounting guidance outside the scope of ASC 842.Lessee Finance LeasesThe vast majority of the Company's finance leases are related to the towers subject to prepaid master lease agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), and are recorded as \"Property and equipment, net\" on the consolidated balance sheet. See note 4 for further discussion of the Company's prepaid master lease agreements. Finance leases and associated leasehold improvements related to gross property and equipment and accumulated depreciation were $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Finance leases and associated leasehold improvements related to gross property and equipment and accumulated depreciation were $4.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $182 million, $200 million and $211 million, respectively, to \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" related to finance leases. Other Lessee InformationAs of December 31, 2022, the Company's weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for operating leases were 16 years and 3.6%, respectively.76NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The following table is a summary of the Company's maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022:Years Ending December 31,ThereafterTotal undiscounted lease paymentsLess: Imputed interestTotal operating lease liabilities20232024202520262027Operating leases(a)$568 $561 $545 $538 $531 $5,660 $8,403 $(2,172)$6,231  (a)Excludes the Company's contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from the Company's operating lease liability. Such contingencies are recognized as expense in the period they are resolved.14.Operating Segments and Concentrations of Credit RiskOperating SegmentsThe Company's operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. The Towers segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's more than 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The Towers segment also reflects certain ancillary services relating to the Company's towers, predominately consisting of site development services and installation services. The Fiber segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's approximately (1) 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (2) 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cells and fiber solutions geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The measurements of profit or loss used by the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") to evaluate the performance of its operating segments are (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin and (3) segment operating profit. The Company defines segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. The Company defines segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately.Costs that are directly attributable to Towers and Fiber are assigned to those respective segments. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in the Company's segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. The \"Other\" column (1) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest income, other income (expense), income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense, and (2) reconciles segment operating profit to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segment’s performance. The \"Other\" total assets balance includes corporate assets such as cash and cash equivalents which have not been allocated to specific segments. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company's operating segments.77NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Year Ended December 31, 2022TowersFiberOtherConsolidatedTotalSegment site rental revenues$4,322 $1,967 $6,289 Segment services and other revenues685 12 697 Segment revenues5,007 1,979 6,986 Segment site rental costs of operations918 650 1,568 Segment services and other costs of operations447 9 456 Segment costs of operations(a)(b)1,365 659 2,024 Segment site rental gross margin3,404 1,317 4,721 Segment services and other gross margin238 3 241 Segment selling, general and administrative expenses(b)115 190 305 Segment operating profit (loss)3,527 1,130 4,657 Other selling, general and administrative expenses(b)$317 317 Stock-based compensation expense156 156 Depreciation, amortization and accretion1,707 1,707 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs699 699 Other (income) expenses to reconcile to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes(c)87 87 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes$1,691 Capital expenditures$185 $1,058 $67 $1,310 Total assets (at year end)$22,210 $16,010 $701 $38,921 Total goodwill (at year end)$5,127 $4,958 $— $10,085  (a)Exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion shown separately.(b)Segment costs of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 excludes (1) stock-based compensation expense of $28 million and (2) prepaid lease purchase price adjustments of $16 million.

On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint announced the completion of their previously disclosed merger.Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivables. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents by maintaining such deposits at high credit quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions. The Company's restricted cash is predominately held and directed by a trustee (see note 2). The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues from tenants in the wireless industry. The Company also has a concentration in its volume of business with T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless or their agents that accounts for a significant portion of the Company's revenues, receivables and deferred site rental receivables. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its tenants, the use of tenant leases with contractually determinable payment terms or proactive management of past due balances.79NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 15.Other Operating IncomeDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, T-Mobile notified the Company that it was cancelling approximately 5,700 small cells initially contracted with Sprint (\"2020 Cancellation\") prior to its merger with T-Mobile. The majority of the cancelled small cells were not yet constructed and, upon completion, would have been located at the same locations as other T-Mobile small cells. The 2020 Cancellation resulted in T-Mobile accelerating payment of all contractual rental obligations associated with the approximately 5,700 small cells as well as the payment of capital costs incurred to date.The Company received approximately $308 million from T-Mobile pursuant to the 2020 Cancellation, and recognized receipt of this payment as \"Other operating income\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Company previously received upfront payments from Sprint for certain of the small cells subject to the 2020 Cancellation, which the Company previously recorded as \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on its consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the 2020 Cancellation, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized the unamortized portion of such upfront payments, or approximately $54 million, as \"Other operating income\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020.See also note 2 for a discussion of the Company's separate evaluation and write-off during the year ended December 31, 2020 of property and equipment previously recorded related to the cancelled small cells.16.Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe following table is a summary of the supplemental cash flow information during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.  Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information:Cash payments related to operating lease liabilities(a)$560 $550 $538 Interest paid684 661 653 Income taxes paid 10 20 19 Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities:New ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities191 573 627 Increase (decrease) in accounts payable for purchases of property and equipment(5)3 27 Purchase of property and equipment under finance leases and installment land purchases28 25 33  (a)Excludes the Company's contingent payments pursuant to operating leases, which are recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.The reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within various lines on the consolidated balance sheet to amounts reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows is shown below.As of December 31,202220212020Cash and cash equivalents$156 $292 $232 Restricted cash, current166 169 144 Restricted cash reported within other assets, net5 5 5 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$327 $466 $381  17.Subsequent EventsCommon Stock DividendOn February 7, 2023, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.565 per common share.

Based upon their evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's CEO and CFO, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Based on the Company's assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K.(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.(d) Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsBecause of its inherent limitations, the Company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.82Item 9B.    Other InformationOn February 23, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective upon filing, to correct an error contained in the Certificate of Amendment to the Charter filed on May 20, 2022 (\"Amendment\") in connection with an increase of authorized shares. The Amendment inadvertently included an incorrect number of the Company’s total authorized shares of stock and shares of common stock that were previously approved by the board of directors and stockholders.The foregoing summary description of the Certificate of Correction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Correction, filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference.

We refer to our towers, small cells and fiber assets collectively as \"communications infrastructure,\" and to our customers on our communications infrastructure as \"tenants.\" Our operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber, which includes both small cells and fiber solutions. Our core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to our shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). We seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure, which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Over the last two decades, we have assembled a leading portfolio of towers predominately through acquisitions from large wireless carriers or their predecessors. More recently, both through acquisitions and new construction of small cells and fiber, we have extended our communications infrastructure presence by investing significantly in our Fiber segment. Through our product offerings of towers and small cells, we seek to provide a comprehensive solution to enable our wireless tenants to expand coverage and capacity for their wireless networks. Furthermore, within our Fiber segment, we seek to generate cash flow growth and stockholder return by deploying our fiber for both small cells\\' and fiber solutions\\' tenants.Approximately 56% and 71% of our towers are located in the 50 and 100 largest U.S. basic trading areas (\"BTAs\"), respectively. Our towers have a significant presence in each of the top 100 BTAs. We derive approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we own, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, and we derive approximately 60% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we lease, sublease, manage or license. The contracts for the land under our towers have an average total remaining life of approximately 36 years (including all renewal terms exercisable at our option), weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. The majority of our small cells and fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas, including a presence within every major U.S. market. The vast majority of our fiber assets are located on public rights-of-way. Our largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which collectively accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2022 consolidated site rental revenues. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. Site rental revenues represented 90% of our 2022 consolidated net revenues, of which 69% and 31% were from our Towers segment and Fiber segment, respectively. Within our Fiber segment, 68% and 32% of our 2022 site rental revenues related to fiber solutions and small cells, respectively. The vast majority of our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and are derived from long-term tenant contracts. See \"Item 1. Business—The Company\" for further information. As of December 31, 2022, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants\\' option, our tenant contracts had a weighted-average remaining life of approximately six years and represented $40 billion of expected future cash inflows. As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). StrategyAs a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per-share results. The key elements of our strategy are to:•Grow cash flows from our existing communications infrastructure. We are focused on maximizing the recurring site rental cash flows generated from providing our tenants with long-term access to our shared infrastructure assets, 4which we believe is the core driver of value for our stockholders. Tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment (collectively, \"tenant additions\") enable our tenants to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for data, while generating high incremental returns for our business. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells through our shared communications infrastructure model provide a comprehensive, efficient and cost-effective solution for our wireless tenants\\' growing networks. Additionally, we believe our ability to share our fiber assets across multiple tenants to both deploy small cells and offer fiber solutions allows us to generate cash flows and increase stockholder return.•Return cash generated by operating activities to common stockholders in the form of dividends. We believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities appropriately provides common stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected long-term stockholder value while still allowing us to retain sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth. We believe this decision reflects the translation of the high-quality, long-term contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to common stockholders.•Invest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. In addition to adding tenants to existing communications infrastructure, we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. These investments include constructing and acquiring new communications infrastructure that we expect will generate future cash flow growth and attractive long-term returns by adding tenants to those assets over time. Our historical investments have included the following (in no particular order):◦construction of towers, fiber and small cells; ◦acquisitions of towers, fiber and small cells; ◦acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); ◦improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; ◦purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and ◦purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. Our strategy to create long-term stockholder value is based on our belief that there will be considerable future demand for our communications infrastructure based on the location of our assets and the rapid and continuing growth in the demand for data. We believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue, will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure, and will create other growth opportunities for us, such as demand for newly constructed or acquired communications infrastructure, as described above. Further, we seek to augment the long-term value creation associated with growing our recurring site rental cash flows by offering certain ancillary site development and installation services within our Towers segment.REIT StatusWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and, therefore, are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income or assets, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income, (2) taxes related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"), (3) franchise taxes, (4) property taxes and (5) transfer taxes. In addition, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. For taxable years beginning before 2026, qualified REIT dividends (within the meaning of Section 199A(e)(3) of the Code) constitute a part of a non-corporate taxpayer\\'s \"qualified business income amount\" and thus our non-corporate U.S. stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20% of such dividends received from us. Without further legislative action, the 20% deduction applicable to qualified REIT dividends will expire on January 1, 2026.The vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the REIT. See notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.Our foreign assets and operations (including our tower operations in Puerto Rico) most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether or not they are included in a TRS.5To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, after the utilization of our NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) (see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements). Our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for risks associated with our REIT status. Industry OverviewConsumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidth-intensive devices. This increase in data consumption is driven by factors such as growth in (1) mobile entertainment (such as mobile video, mobile applications and social networking), (2) mobile internet usage (supporting web browsing and trends in telehealth, remote working, online learning and other remote communications), (3) machine-to-machine applications or the \"Internet of Things\" (such as connected cars and smart city technologies), and (4) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications). As a result, consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidth-intensive devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other emerging and embedded devices, and U.S. wireless carriers are among the first carriers in the world to begin offering commercial 5th Generation (\"5G\") mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth.We expect the following factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure:•consumers\\' growing wireless data consumption leading major wireless carriers to upgrade and enhance their networks through the efficient use of both towers and small cells, including in connection with 5G deployments, in an effort to improve network quality and capacity and customer retention or satisfaction;•prior and future potential spectrum auctioned, licensed or made available by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") enabling additional wireless carrier network development; •next-generation technologies and new uses for wireless communications may potentially result in new entrants or increased demand in the wireless industry, which may include companies involved in the continued evolution and deployment of the Internet of Things; •the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive applications could result in demand for high-capacity, multi-location, fiber-based network solutions; and•increased government initiatives to expand broadband infrastructure to support connectivity throughout the U.S.The CompanyVirtually all of our operations in both our Towers and Fiber operating segments are located in the U.S. For more information about our operating segments, see \"Item 7. MD&A—Results of Operations\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Our core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to our shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in the U.S. We believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our tenants\\' networks and organizations. See \"Item 1. Business—Strategy.\"Towers Segment. We believe towers are the most efficient and cost-effective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments. We acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the largest U.S. wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999, including towers from (1)\\xa0AT&T in 2013, (2) T-Mobile in 2012, (3)\\xa0companies now part of T-Mobile in 2007, (4) companies now part of Verizon Wireless in 1999 and 2000 and (5)\\xa0companies now part of AT&T in 1999 and 2000.We generally receive monthly rental payments and, in some cases, upfront payments, from our Towers tenants pursuant to long-term tenant contracts with (1) initial contract terms of five to 15 years, (2)\\xa0multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each, exercisable at the option of the tenant, (3) limited termination rights for our tenants and (4) contractual escalations of the rental price. We strive to negotiate with our existing tenant base for longer contractual terms, which often contain fixed escalation rates.Our Towers tenant contracts, while amended and re-negotiated over time, have historically led to a long-term relationship with tenants on our towers, resulting in a retention rate generally between 98% and 99% each year. In general, each renewable tenant contract automatically renews at the end of its term unless (1) the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew or (2) the contract is amended or re-negotiated. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding expected higher non-renewals (which we define as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates) as a result of the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. See note 3 to our 6consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts without consideration of tenant renewal options as of December 31, 2022.The average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on (1)\\xa0aggregate tenant volume, (2)\\xa0the location of the tower, or (3)\\xa0the amount of tower and ground space leased to a tenant, which can be influenced by the quantity, size, and weight of the tenant\\'s antenna installation or related equipment. When possible, we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with tenant contract amendments, pursuant to which our tenants add antennas or other equipment to our towers or ground space on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting tenant contracts. Our Towers tenant contracts and pricing are not influenced by whether or not we perform the respective site development or installation services. See \"—Services\" below for a further discussion of our tower installation services. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the average number of tenants (calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto) per tower was approximately 2.4.Fiber Segment. Our Fiber segment consists of small cells and fiber solutions. •Our small cells offload data traffic from towers and bolster our tenants\\' network capacity where data demand is the greatest and are typically attached to public right-of-way infrastructure, including utility poles and street lights.•We offer fiber solutions to large wireless carriers and organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands. Our fiber solutions provide essential connectivity resources needed to create integrated networks and support organizations. Most of our fiber assets were acquired through transactions dating back to 2012, with the largest transactions occurring in 2017. Our fiber assets include those we acquired from: (1) NextG Networks, Inc. in 2012, (2) Quanta Fiber Networks, Inc. in 2015, (3) FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC and certain other subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, Inc. in 2017, (4) Wilcon Holdings LLC in 2017 and (5) LTS Group Holdings LLC in 2017.We generally receive monthly recurring payments and, in some cases, upfront payments, from our Fiber tenants pursuant to tenant contracts with initial terms that generally vary between three to 20 years. The average monthly rental payment from a new tenant can vary based on the amount or cost of (1) construction for initial and subsequent tenants, (2) fiber strand requirements and supply, (3) equipment at the site, (4) the market in the U.S. where the fiber is located and (5) any upfront payment received.Additional Site Rental Information. For both our Towers and Fiber segments, we have existing master agreements with our largest tenants, including T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Such agreements provide certain terms (including economic terms) that govern underlying contracts (entered into during the term of the master agreements) regarding the right to use our communications infrastructure by such tenants.Approximately half of our site rental costs of operations consists of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses (primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure), property taxes, repairs and maintenance, employee compensation or related benefit costs, and utilities. Assuming current leasing activity levels, our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation. We seek to add tenants to our existing communications infrastructure at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns to our business. Once constructed, our communications infrastructure requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures, including maintenance or other non-discretionary capital expenditures, which are typically between 1% and 2% of net revenues. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental payments we owe to landlords pursuant to our operating lease agreements.Services. As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. In 2022, approximately 45% of our services and other revenues related to installation services, and the remainder predominately related to site development services. We seek to grow our services revenues by capitalizing on (1) increased leasing volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades, (2) promoting site development services, (3) expanding the scope of our services, and (4) focusing on tenant service and deployment speed. We have the capability and expertise to install, with the assistance of our network of subcontractors, equipment or antenna systems for our tenants. We do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our tenants on our communications infrastructure as other service providers also provide these services (see also \"—Competition\" below). These services are typically non-recurring and highly competitive, with several competitors in most markets. Typically, our site development services and installation services are billed on a fixed fee basis, and the terms and pricing of both site development services and installation services are negotiated separately from our tenant contracts.7Customers. Our Towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks.Our Fiber customers generally consist of large wireless carriers and organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands, such as enterprise (including healthcare and financial), wholesale, government and education institutions.Our three largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Collectively, these three tenants accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2022 site rental revenues. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for risks associated with our dependence on a small number of customers and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. For 2022, our site rental revenues by tenant were as follows:Sales and Marketing. Our sales organization markets our communications infrastructure with the objective of contracting access with tenants to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction. We seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our tenants and increase tenant satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our (1) existing unique communications infrastructure footprint, (2) tenant relationships, (3)\\xa0process-centric approach, (4)\\xa0technological tools and (5) construction capabilities and expertise.Our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors, including tenant type (such as large wireless carriers, vertical customers and organizations), product offering and geography. A team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest tenants. These directors work to develop new business opportunities, as well as to ensure that tenants\\' communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts for our communications infrastructure. Sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our tenants that are expanding their networks, entering new markets, seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings, bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add-on business. In addition to our full-time sales or marketing staff, a number of senior-level employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective tenants.Competition. We face competition for site rental tenants from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including competitors that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors, such as cable providers) or small cells, (2) tenants who elect to self-perform or (3) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.Some of our largest competitors in the Towers segment are American Tower Corporation and SBA Communications Corporation. Our Fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography. Some of the larger competitors in the Fiber segment include other owners of fiber, tenants who elect to self-perform and recent and potential entrants into small cells and the fiber solutions business. We believe that location, existing communications infrastructure footprint, deployment speed, quality of service, expertise, reputation, capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of competition in our industry.Competitors to our services offering can include site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners or managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, our tenants\\' internal staff or contractors, or telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors. We believe that our tenants base their decisions on the outsourcing of services on criteria such as a company\\'s experience, record of accomplishment, reputation, price and time for completion of a project.8Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")Our shared communications infrastructure model results in the use of fewer resources, including water, energy, metals and other materials, than would otherwise be needed to construct and maintain communications infrastructure. We are committed to operating responsibly and ethically and considering social and environmental impacts as we make business decisions. We maintain annual sustainability targets in our senior unsecured credit facility. Further, we have a goal to be carbon neutral by 2025 in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by continuing to invest in energy reduction initiatives, sourcing renewable energy, and, to a lesser extent, utilizing carbon credits or offsets. We plan to continue investing in projects that are both good for our business and good for the environment.The Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee assists the board of directors with ESG oversight. Our executive management team and senior management keep our board of directors apprised of our ESG priorities, goals and initiatives. Together, our board of directors and executive management team define our strategic approach to managing actual and potential impacts of significant ESG risks and opportunities.Additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and progress is also available through the Investors section of our website at https://investor.crowncastle.com. The information on our website, including our ESG Reports, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference into this 2022 Form 10-K or any other filings with the SEC unless expressly noted in any such other filings.Human CapitalThe people who work for Crown Castle are essential to our ability to execute on our strategy. As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 5,000 people, all of whom were based in the U.S. From time to time, we also add contingent workers to support our business.We believe attracting, developing and retaining talented employees is paramount to serving our customers and our communities and creating value for our stockholders. Our core values shape our culture, drive our decision-making and guide our interactions with one another and our customers. Our 2022 annual employee survey indicated strong employee engagement exceeding U.S. company norms.We continue to focus on building and retaining a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive community to make our company stronger and more innovative. We actively partner with non-profit and community organizations to create a diverse talent pipeline. In addition, our board of directors is currently comprised of 60% female or racially diverse directors, including each of the four most recently appointed directors.The well-being of our employees is a crucial element of our safety culture, employee engagement and productivity. We offer a competitive total rewards package which includes market-based pay, performance-based annual incentive awards, healthcare and retirement benefits, mental health benefits, parental and family leave, holiday and paid time off and tuition assistance. We further invest in our employees\\' professional growth and development by providing resources and opportunities to hone their skills and expand their subject-matter expertise, which empowers them to advance their careers and enables our business to prosper. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages.Regulatory and Environmental MattersWe are required to comply with a variety of federal, state and local regulations and laws in the U.S., including FCC and Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") regulations and those discussed under \"—Environmental\" below. To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations, including any environmental regulations. The summary below is based on regulations currently in effect, and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be fined or lose our rights to conduct some of our business.Federal Regulations. Both the FCC and the FAA regulate towers used for wireless communications, radio, or television broadcasting. Such regulations control the siting, construction, modification, lighting, and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require the registration of tower facilities with the FCC and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used. In addition, the FCC and the FAA have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location, including proximity to airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights 9are reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation, which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements. The FCC requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with FAA rules and are registered with the FCC, if required by its regulations. Where tower lighting is required by FAA regulation, tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages.State and Local Regulations. The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities\\' jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells. The law, however, limits state and local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by such authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or prohibit altogether (actually or effectively) the provision of wireless communications. Additionally, the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations.Local regulations include city and other local ordinances (including subdivision and zoning ordinances), approvals for construction, modification and removal of towers and small cells, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require us to obtain prior approval from local officials. Local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or small cells, or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents\\' concerns regarding the height, visibility, or other characteristics of such infrastructure. Over the last several years, the FCC has adopted regulations and 30 states have passed legislation intended to expedite and streamline the deployment of wireless networks, including establishing presumptively reasonable timeframes for reviews by local and state governments. Notwithstanding such developments, decisions of local regulatory authorities and utilities in certain jurisdictions may continue to adversely affect deployment timing and cost. Certain of our subsidiaries hold state authorizations, including authorizations to act as competitive local exchange carriers (\"CLECs\"), to provide intrastate telecommunication services in addition to FCC authorization to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services. State authorizations may help promote access to public rights-of-way, which is beneficial to the timely deployment of fiber and small cells, and often allow us to deploy such infrastructure in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay, restrict, or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower and rooftop sites. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding rights to our infrastructure.Environmental. We are required to comply with a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality, including air and water quality, and wildlife. To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding compliance with laws and regulations.The construction of new towers and small cells or, in some cases, their modification in the U.S. may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (\"NEPA\"), which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions. NEPA regulations require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction. If the FCC determines that the proposed tower or small cells construction or modification presents a significant environmental impact, the FCC is required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which is subject to public comment. Such determination could significantly delay the FCC\\'s approval of the construction or modification.Our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission, or remediation of, or exposure to, hazardous or non-hazardous substances, materials, or wastes. As an owner, lessee, or operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint-and-several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination relating to existing or historical operations; or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination. In general, our tenant contracts prohibit our tenants from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our tenants to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them.We are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure. In recent years, the scientific community has extensively studied low-level radio frequency emissions to determine whether they have any connection to certain negative health effects, such as cancer.We have compliance programs and monitoring projects designed to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us.10Available InformationWe maintain a website at www.crowncastle.com.

Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).Tenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on consumers\\' and organizations\\' demand for data. Additionally, the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure, or renew or extend existing tenant contracts on our communications infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:•availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests;•location of our communications infrastructure;•financial condition of our tenants, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital, including through government funding;•willingness of our tenants to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;•need for integrated networks and organizations;•availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;•increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our tenants;•mergers or consolidations by and among our tenants;•changes in, or success of, our tenants\\' business models;•governmental regulations and initiatives, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure;•cost of constructing communications infrastructure;•our market competition, including tenants that may elect to self-perform;•technological changes, including those (1)\\xa0affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or (2)\\xa0resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; and•our ability to efficiently satisfy our tenants\\' service requirements.A slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. If our current or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services. The amount, timing, and mix of our tenants\\' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. Changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure. As a result, changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new and emerging technologies (including small cells and fiber solutions), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Furthermore, the industries in which our tenants operate (particularly those in the wireless industry) could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for data or general economic conditions. There can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services. In addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services. Such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.12A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues, reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services and impact our dividend per share growth.Our three largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. The loss of any one of our largest tenants as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, communications infrastructure assets, or intangible assets (including goodwill), or (4) other adverse effects to our business. We cannot guarantee that tenant contracts with our largest tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their tenant contracts with us. In addition to our three largest tenants, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from (1) fiber solutions tenants and (2) new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services. Such tenants (including those dependent on government funding) may be smaller or have less financial resources than our three largest tenants, may have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital. Consolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example, where they are co-residents on a tower or small cell network, which may result in the termination, non-renewal or re-negotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant contracts, we generally expect that the impact to our site rental revenues from any termination of our tenant contracts as a result of such potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. Such consolidation (or potential consolidation) may result in a reduction or slowdown in such tenants\\' network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. Tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure and services, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain long-lived assets.On January 6, 2022, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile that contemplates T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. We anticipate that this consolidation will result in higher Towers non-renewals in 2025, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $200 million. Except for full year 2025, we expect our annual Towers non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues. Additionally, we anticipate that the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation will result in small cell non-renewals, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $45 million, with approximately half occurring in 2023 and the remainder occurring in 2024 and 2025. Excluding the anticipated impact from the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation, we expect consolidated annual small cell non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues.Due to network consolidation non-renewals and interest rate increases discussed in \"—Risks Related to Our Debt and Equity,\" we expect our annual dividend per share growth through 2025 to be below our long-term annual target.See \"Item 1. Business—The Company\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. We seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings, or other strategic growth opportunities. In the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. Such transactions or activities could be complex, costly and time-consuming, or cause disruptions in, increase risk to or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things, such transactions and activities may: •disrupt our business relationships with our tenants, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;•divert capital and the time or attention of management away from other business operations, including as a result of post-transaction integration activities;•fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated; •increase operational risk or volatility in our business; •not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected;•impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees; •increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees; or13•result in the need for additional TRSs or contributions of certain assets to TRSs, which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Over the last decade, we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our Fiber business, which is a much less mature business for us than our Towers business. Our Fiber segment represented 31% and 33% of our site rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The business model for our Fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our Towers operations, including those relating to tenant base, competition, contract terms (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), upfront capital requirements, landlord demographics, deployment and ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements, government regulations, growth rates and applicable laws.While our Fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our Towers operations, they also have certain operational risks (including the scalability of processes) that are different from our Towers business, including:•the use of public rights-of-way and franchise agreements; •the use of poles and conduits owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties; •risks relating to overbuilding competitive fiber assets; •risks relating to the specific markets in which we choose or plan to operate;•risks relating to construction hazards, including boring, trenching, utility and maintenance of traffic hazards;•construction management and construction-related billings to tenants;•risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks, or tenants utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets;•the risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands;•damage to our assets and the need to maintain, repair, upgrade and periodically replace our assets;•the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software;•network data security risks; •the risk of new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber; •potential damage to our overall reputation as a communications infrastructure provider; and•the use of CLEC status.In addition, the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether. For example, our tenants have initially focused on utilizing towers in the first phase of deploying their 5G networks, which has led to delays in some of our small cell deployments. We anticipate that these delays will be temporary, as our tenants plan for the next phase of their 5G network deployment which we believe will require small cells at scale. Our Fiber operations also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our Towers business as a result of numerous factors, including those stemming from the deployment, location or nature of the assets involved. There may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve, and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.Our construction projects and related contracts can be long-term, complex in nature, dangerous, costly and challenging to execute. The quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage (1) the associated tenant relationship and (2) the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources. In connection with our construction projects, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, labor availability and productivity, and contractor pricing and performance.In addition, the construction projects (including modifications of existing communications infrastructure) can pose certain safety risks, including:•risks resulting from elevated work, including falling hazards;•risks of third-party non-compliance with safety regulations, industry best practices or other applicable standards;•risks associated with utility hazards, including gas line, electrical or sewage strikes, which may result in explosions, electrocution and other potentially catastrophic events; and•risk of potential wildfires, including due to welding, grinding, cutting, or other construction activity.14Such safety risks may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, suspension of operations or services, or significant damage to the environment, creating financial, regulatory or reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. See \"Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events\" below for additional information regarding potential adverse impacts to our business which may result from wildfires and other climate-related events.Further, investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels. Additionally, contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. We often experience unforeseen delays from municipalities and utility companies that result in longer construction timelines than expected, which impact our ability to timely deliver on our projects. We may also experience unforeseen delays and increased project costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which may impact the availability of equipment and materials needed for, and availability of contractors to work on, our construction projects. Our failure to manage such tenant relationships, project resources, and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner and appropriately manage safety risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.Improvements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure. For example, new technologies and spectrum that may promote network sharing, joint development, backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants, such as signal combining technologies or network virtualization, may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure. In addition, other technologies, such as WiFi, blimps, satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed. In addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.The property interests and other rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land under our towers, are derived from leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and franchise and other agreements. A loss of these interests and other rights may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms.Our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers are located depends on our ability to purchase such land, by acquiring fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the agreements relating to such land. Approximately 10% of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 was derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years. If we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located, our business may be adversely affected.As of December 31, 2022, approximately 53% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. Even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the T-Mobile or AT&T towers for business or other reasons. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. Additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of December 31, 2022 is as follows:•22% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master lease or other related agreements with AT&T for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the 15respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.•31% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases or other agreements with T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). Approximately half of such towers have an initial term of 32 years (through May 2037), and we have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of such leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile for approximately $2.3 billion. The remainder of such towers have a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase such towers from T-Mobile at the end of the respective terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. In addition, another 1% of our towers under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with T-Mobile are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with AT&T. We have the option to purchase these towers from AT&T at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due prior to 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).Under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to operate and manage, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. If one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. If our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.For our small cells and fiber, we must maintain rights-of-way, franchise, pole attachment, conduit use, fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct, maintain and operate our fiber assets. Access to rights-of-way may depend on our CLEC status, and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will (1) recognize such CLEC status or (2) not change their laws concerning CLEC access to rights-of-way. If a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed, we might be forced to abandon our assets, which may adversely impact our business. In order to operate our assets, we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms, we may face increased costs or reduced revenues.Additionally, in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations, we often need to obtain new or additional rights-of-way and other agreements. Our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and cost-effective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint, which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.The operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its non-recurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. Our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•competition;•the timing, mix and amount of tenant network investments;•the rate and volume of tenant deployment plans;•unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;•economic weakness or uncertainty;•labor availability and productivity;•our market share; and•changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.16If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies (such as 5G) may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new wireless technologies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services and technologies. If a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Despite existing security measures, certain of our information technology and communications infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious software, cyber-attacks and other security breaches. In addition, our increased reliance on cloud- or internet-based services and on remote access to information systems to accommodate our hybrid work environment increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity incidents. An attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants or access by our tenants to certain of our information technology systems, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants, (3) data transmitted over our tenants\\' networks being compromised or misappropriated, or (4) business or other sensitive data being compromised, misappropriated or lost. Although we believe we have a comprehensive incident response plan and other cybersecurity measures and policies in place, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants\\' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. Additionally, security incidents impacting our tenants, vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. If an actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity or information technology, or that of our cloud- or internet-based service providers, occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose tenants. Further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. In addition, our acquisitions, both past and future, may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above. While we maintain insurance that includes coverage in the event of cybersecurity or other information technology breaches, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such incidents.Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.We could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events, such as extreme weather events or natural disasters (including as a result of any potential effects of climate change), or acts of vandalism. There is increasing concern that global climate change is occurring and could result in increased frequency of certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Although we have implemented a wildfire risk mitigation program, the effects of climate change have increased the risk and extent of wildfires that could potentially result from certain of our construction and maintenance projects and other operating activities. We cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our business. Any such unforeseen events could, among other things, damage or delay deployment of our communications infrastructure, interrupt or delay service to our tenants or could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.While we currently maintain insurance policies that include coverage in the event of natural disasters and other unforeseen events, including possible incidents in which our actions (or the actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to such events, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such events. Further, we do not maintain, and do not expect to maintain, insurance policies that provide adequate coverage in the event that our actions (or those actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to a wildfire event, as a result of the fact that such insurance policies are generally not economically available.17As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.Our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts (including amendments to tenant contracts upon modification of existing towers, small cells or fiber), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate. Competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. In addition, competition (primarily in our fiber solutions business) may, in certain circumstances, cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations. We face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including those that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors such as cable providers) or small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.Our Fiber business generally has different competitors than those in our Towers business, including other owners of fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions, some of which may have larger networks, greater financial resources or more experience in managing such assets than we have.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.There can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies, which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure, will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. In addition, demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.Our focus on and disclosure of our ESG position, metrics, strategy, goals and initiatives expose us to potential litigation and other adverse effects to our business.In recent years, our investors, tenants, employees and other stakeholders have increased their focus on ESG matters and disclosure. In response, we have published ESG reports and related materials and made other public announcements regarding our ESG position, initiatives and goals. Our ESG metrics, initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards that are still developing and that may not be uniformly adopted or applied by other companies, processes and internal controls that continue to evolve, potentially missing or deficient third-party data, wide range of acceptable estimation techniques, and estimates and assumptions that are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty and may change more frequently than those underlying our financial metrics. Our ESG initiatives and goals may be difficult to implement and may increase operating costs and result in changes to certain of our operations, assets and processes. In addition, a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations are developing climate change-based laws and regulations, with varying scopes and complexity, that could, if adopted, significantly increase compliance burdens and associated costs.Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, accurately report our metrics or adhere to public statements exposes us to potential litigation, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.We operate in a challenging labor market and failure to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees could adversely affect our business, operations and costs. Our ability to sustain and grow our business and execute on our strategy requires us, in part, to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key management personnel and other talent. We have experienced an extremely competitive labor market that continues to tighten due to macroeconomic conditions and elevated levels of turnover stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. To remain competitive, some employers are offering increased compensation and benefits and opportunities to work with greater flexibility, including remote work on a permanent basis. We currently operate under a hybrid work model, meaning that the majority of our employees have the flexibility to work remotely for a portion of the workweek. As the competition for talent remains intense, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs to attract, recruit and retain necessary talent, including increased compensation, benefits or other employee-related costs. Our failure to successfully attract, recruit and retain key employees could adversely impact our business, operations, and costs.18Risks Related to Our Debt and EquityOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $21.7 billion as of February\\xa021, 2023). See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. As a result of our substantial indebtedness:•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;•we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;•we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\";•we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;•we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;•we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates (see below);•we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments;•we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet our debt payment obligations;•we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; and•we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT due to limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.Over the past 11 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate eight times for a cumulative increase of 4.50% and has signaled further increases in the near-term, which could further increase interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of February\\xa021, 2023, approximately 12% of our outstanding indebtedness consisted of variable interest rates, with a weighted average rate of 5.6%. Any significant increase in the amount of our variable rate debt or interest rate on such debt could adversely impact our borrowing cost, financial results and our ability to meet our dividend growth targets, strategically deploy our capital or execute our business plan. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our interest rate risk.Currently we have debt instruments in place that limit, in certain circumstances, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. In addition, the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility (\"2016 Credit Agreement\"), which consists of our senior unsecured term loan A facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively, \"2016 Credit Facility\"), contains financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. Furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. If our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.CCI is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, CCI\\'s sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. Earnings and cash flows generated by CCI\\'s subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to CCI, in the absence of any special conditions, such as a continuing event of default. However, CCI\\'s subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.19We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which, upon final maturity, we will need to refinance or repay. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all. As of February 21, 2023, approximately 51% of our fixed rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%, is scheduled to mature over the next five years. If interest rates remain elevated or continue to increase, we may have to (1) refinance our maturing fixed rate debt at interest rates that exceed the current interest rates on such debt or (2) use our variable interest rate debt to repay such fixed rate debt, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.Economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact (1) the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above, (2) our ability to draw the full amount of our $7.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Facility (\"2016 Revolver\"), that, as of February\\xa021, 2023, had $6.7 billion of undrawn availability, or (3) our ability to issue the full amount of the $2.0\\xa0billion commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\") under our unsecured commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), that, as of February\\xa021, 2023, had $1.2 billion outstanding.If we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. In such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations. Failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. Our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. We maintain an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program (\"2021 ATM Program\") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million to or through sales agents. As of February\\xa021, 2023, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2021 ATM Program. From time to time, we may refresh or implement a new \"at-the-market\" stock offering program. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February\\xa021, 2023, we had approximately 433 million shares of common stock outstanding.We have reserved an aggregate of approximately 16 million of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our stock compensation plans.Further, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, (\"Charter\"), amended and restated by-laws (\"By-laws\") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti-takeover provisions include:•the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; •advance notice and other procedural requirements relating to director nominations or proposals submitted by stockholders for actions to be taken at annual meetings of stockholders; and•provisions that the state courts or, in certain circumstances, the federal courts, in Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us, our directors, officers, employees and stockholders, and, unless the 20Company otherwise consents, that the federal courts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). Since the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought pursuant to the Securities Act, there may be uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. Stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws, and this provision does not apply to claims for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction (such as under the Exchange Act).Our By-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our Chief Executive Officer or the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.In addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.Risks Relating to Corporate ComplianceIf we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.A variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in \"Item 1. Business.\" Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties, require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws, will not adversely affect our business (including our REIT status), increase delays or result in additional costs. We also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations, such as those governing environmental and safety matters. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us.Risks Relating to Our REIT StatusFuture dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities.\\xa0In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.During each of the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, totaling approximately $1.9 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.565 per share, which represents an increase of 6.5% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2022. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. Any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs) to our stockholders. Our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See also \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend.\" As discussed in \"Item 1. Business—Strategy,\" we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. Our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): construction of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. External financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. As a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.21Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, thereby increasing our tax obligations and reducing our available cash.As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders.While we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the importance of ongoing factual determinations, the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting REITs, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year. In addition, the present U.S. federal tax treatment of REITs is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and any such change might adversely affect our REIT status or benefits. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that such changes, if enacted, might have on our business. However, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business, including our REIT status. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, then:•we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income;•we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and, for years beginning before January 1, 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax; and•we would be disqualified from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified.Although we may have federal NOLs available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal NOLs have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.Under the Code, for taxable years beginning in or after 2018, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. These limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a REIT.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are required to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement as described above. We commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal NOLs of approximately $1.5 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.From time to time, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would 22otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Furthermore, the REIT dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.In addition to satisfying the 90% distribution requirement, to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. Compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent, limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. In addition, our status as a REIT may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.Moreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock. In order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer \"individuals\" (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year. In order to facilitate compliance with the REIT rules, our Charter includes provisions regarding REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any \"person\" (as defined in our Charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than (1) 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or (2) 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock. In addition, our Charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. These ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders. CertificationsWe submitted the Chief Executive Officer certification required by Section\\xa0303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") Listed Company Manual, relating to compliance with the NYSE\\'s corporate governance listing standards, to the NYSE on May 26, 2022 with no qualifications. We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section\\xa0302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this 2022 Form 10-K.23Item 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0PropertiesCommunications Infrastructure We own, lease or manage more than 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. Towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 300 feet. Our tenants\\' wireless equipment may be placed on towers, building rooftops and other structures. Our towers are located on tracts of land that support the towers, equipment shelters and, where applicable, guy-wires to stabilize the tower.Additionally, we own or lease approximately 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting our (1) approximately 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (2) fiber solutions. The majority of our fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas. Our small cells and fiber are typically located outdoors and are often attached to public right-of-way infrastructure, including utility poles or street lights. See the following for further information regarding our communications infrastructure:•\"Item 1. Business—Overview\" for information regarding our tower and fiber portfolios.•\"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material Cash Requirements\" for information regarding our lease obligations.•\"Schedule III - Schedule of Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\" for further information on our productive properties.Approximately 53% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a further discussion. Substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications. Additionally, if so inclined as a result of a request for a tenant addition, we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower, replace a small cell network antenna with another antenna or overlay additional fiber in order to provide additional coverage or capacity, subject to certain restrictions.OfficesOur principal corporate headquarters is owned and located in Houston, Texas. In addition, we have offices throughout the U.S. in locations convenient for the management and operation of our communications infrastructure, with significant consideration being given to the amount of our communications infrastructure located in a particular area. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.Item 3. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Legal ProceedingsWe are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Most of these proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business involve disputes with landlords, vendors, collection matters involving bankrupt tenants, zoning or siting matters, construction, condemnation, tax, employment, or wrongful termination matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us.See the disclosure in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.Item 4. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Mine Safety DisclosuresN/A24PART IIItem 5. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Market for Registrant\\'s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and HoldersOur common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"CCI.\" As of February\\xa021, 2023, there were approximately 542 holders of record of our common stock.Dividend PolicyWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income after the utilization of any available NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). See also \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities—Common Stock\" and notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements.Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our growth in cash flows. The declaration amount and payment of any future dividends, however, are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on then-current or anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing NOLs, or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited under certain circumstances by the terms of our debt instruments.25Performance GraphThe following performance graph is a comparison of the five-year cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock against the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Market Index and the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index for the period commencing December\\xa031, 2017 and ending December\\xa031, 2022.

Site rental revenues represented 90% of our 2022 consolidated net revenues. The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in prior years.Highlights of Business Fundamentals and Results•We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes (see \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements)•Potential growth resulting from the increasing demand for data ◦We expect existing and potential new tenant demand for our communications infrastructure will result from (1)\\xa0new technologies, (2) increased usage of mobile entertainment, mobile internet, and machine-to-machine applications, (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including the use of both towers and small cells, (6) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications), (7) the availability of additional spectrum and (8) increased government initiatives to support connectivity throughout the U.S.◦We expect U.S. wireless carriers will continue to focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity (including through 5G initiatives) by utilizing a combination of towers and small cells. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless tenants\\' growing communications infrastructure needs. ◦We expect organizations will continue to increase the usage of high-bandwidth applications that will require the utilization of more fiber infrastructure and fiber solutions, such as those we provide. ◦Within our Fiber segment, we are able to generate growth and returns for our stockholders by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions tenants. ◦Tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure are achieved at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns. ◦Substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications.•Returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also \"Item 1. Business—Strategy\")◦During 2022, we paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $2.6 billion. See \"Item\\xa07. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend\" for a discussion of the increase to our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2022.•Investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share ◦We had discretionary capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022, predominately resulting from the construction of new communications infrastructure and improvements to existing communications infrastructure in order to support additional tenants. ◦We expect to continue to construct and acquire new communications infrastructure based on our tenants\\' needs and generate attractive long-term returns by adding additional tenants over time. •Site rental revenues under long-term tenant contracts◦Our wireless tenant contracts have initial terms of five to 15 years with contractual escalators and multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each, exercisable at the option of the tenant. ◦Our fiber solutions tenant contracts\\' initial terms generally vary between three to 20 years (including tenant contracts with organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands). ◦As of December 31, 2022, our weighted-average remaining term was approximately six years, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants\\' option, currently representing approximately $40 billion of expected future cash inflows.•Majority of our revenues from large wireless carriers 27◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately three-fourths of our site rental revenues were derived from T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our largest customers.•Majority of land under our towers under long-term control ◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our towers site rental gross margin and approximately 80% of our towers site rental gross margin was derived from towers located on land that we own or control for greater than 10 and 20 years, respectively. The aforementioned percentages include towers located on land that is owned, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, which represented approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin.•Majority of our fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas and are on public rights-of-way •Minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements ◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately 1% of net revenues. •Debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the vast majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our debt)◦As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due January 2028 (\"January 2023 Senior Notes\") and the use of proceeds therefrom, our outstanding debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and weighted average maturity of approximately eight years (assuming anticipated repayment dates where applicable).◦As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, 87% of our debt has fixed rate coupons.◦Our debt service coverage and leverage ratios are within their respective financial maintenance covenants. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.•During 2022, we refinanced and extended the maturities of certain of our debt (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities\" for further discussion of our debt transactions)•Significant cash flows from operations ◦Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022,◦In addition to the positive impact of contractual escalators, we expect to grow our core business of providing access to our communications infrastructure as a result of future anticipated additional demand for our communications infrastructure. Common Stock DividendIn the aggregate, we paid approximately $2.6 billion in common stock dividends during 2022. During each of the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, totaling approximately $1.9 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $1.565 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 6.5% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2022. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our growth in cash flows. Any future common stock dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.Outlook HighlightsThe following are certain highlights of our outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above.•We expect that, when compared to full year 2022, our full year 2023 site rental revenues growth will be positively impacted by tenant additions as large wireless carriers and fiber solutions tenants continue to focus on meeting the increasing demand for data.•We expect to continue to invest a significant amount of our available capital in the form of discretionary capital expenditures for 2023 based on the anticipated returns on such discretionary investments.◦We expect that our discretionary capital expenditures will increase as we accelerate the pace of small cell deployments.•We also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2% of net revenues for full year 2023, consistent with historical annual levels.28Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021 should be read in conjunction with \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and our consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our results of operations and financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 that is not included in this 2022 Form 10-K, see \"Part II, Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022.The following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts (see \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). See \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Non-GAAP and Segment Financial Measures\" for a discussion of our use of (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin, (3) segment operating profit, including their respective definitions, and (4) Adjusted EBITDA, including its definition and a reconciliation to net income (loss).Our operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber.

MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Non-GAAP and Segment Financial Measures.\"292022 and 2021 Total site rental revenues for 2022 grew by $570 million, or 10%, from 2021. This increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below: (In millions of dollars) (a)Represents site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of the impacts from both straight-line accounting and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP.(b)Represents the contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions.(c)Prepaid rent amortization includes amortization of upfront payments received from long-term tenants and other deferred credits.Towers site rental revenues for 2022 were $4.3 billion and increased by $518 million, or 14%, from $3.8 billion during 2021. The increase in Towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, escalators and non-renewals of tenant contracts. Tenant additions were influenced by our tenants\\' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.Fiber site rental revenues for 2022 were $2.0 billion and increased by $52 million, or 3%, from $1.9 billion during 2021. The increase in Fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions. Increased demand for small cells was driven by our tenants\\' network strategy in an effort to provide capacity and relieve network congestion, and increased demand for fiber solutions was driven by increasing demand for data.The increase in Towers site rental gross margin from 2021 to 2022 was related to the previously-mentioned 14% increase in Towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. The increase in Fiber site rental gross margin was predominately related to the previously-mentioned 3% increase in Fiber site rental revenues.Towers services and other gross margin for 2022 was $238 million and increased by $51 million, or 27%, from $187 million during 2021, which is a reflection of the increased volume of activity from carriers\\' network enhancements and the volume and mix of services and other work. Revenues from our services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term tenant contracts.Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2022 were $750 million and increased by $70 million, or 10%, from $680 million during 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our business and certain costs, including travel and facilities, returning to their pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels following our return to office in February 2022.30Towers operating profit for 2022 increased by $532 million, or 18%, from 2021. The increase in Towers operating profit was primarily related to the previously-mentioned increases in Towers site rental gross margin and Towers services and other gross margin.Fiber operating profit for 2022 increased by $19 million, or 2%, from 2021. The increase in Fiber operating profit was primarily related to the previously-mentioned increase in Fiber site rental gross margin.Depreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.7 billion for 2022 and increased by $63 million, or 4%, from 2021. This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were $699 million for 2022 and increased by $42 million, or 6%, from $657 million during 2021. The increase predominately resulted from an increase in the interest rates on the 2016 Term Loan A, 2016 Revolver and outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, as well as an increase in our outstanding indebtedness due to the financing of our discretionary capital expenditures. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our debt and interest rate increases.As a result of repaying certain of our indebtedness in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses on retirement of long-term obligations of\\xa0$28 million\\xa0and\\xa0$145 million\\xa0for the years ended\\xa02022\\xa0and\\xa02021, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.The provisions for income taxes for 2022 and 2021 were $16 million and $21 million, respectively. For both 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Income from continuing operations was $1.7 billion during 2022 compared to $1.2 billion during 2021. The increase was related to (1) growth in our site rental activities in both our Towers and Fiber segments, (2) the previously-mentioned increase in Towers services activity and (3) the decrease in losses of retirement of long-term obligations, partially offset by an increase in expenses, including (1) selling, general and administrative expenses, (2) depreciation, amortization and accretion and (3) interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs.Net income attributable to CCI stockholders increased by $579 million, or 53%, from 2021 to 2022. The increase was due to the previously-mentioned increase in income from continuing operations.Adjusted EBITDA increased by $524 million, or 14%, from 2021 to 2022. The increase was predominately related to the growth in our site rental activities in both our Towers and Fiber segments as well as the previously-mentioned increase in Towers service activity.31Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewGeneral. Our core business generates revenues under long-term tenant contracts (see \"Item 1. Business—Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Overview\") from (1) the largest U.S. wireless carriers and (2) fiber solutions tenants. As a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends, and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. See \"Item 1. Business—Strategy\" for a further discussion of our strategy. We have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. Our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): constructing communications infrastructure, acquiring communications infrastructure, acquiring land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers), improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure, purchasing shares of our common stock, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. We have recently spent, and expect to continue to spend, a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of small cells and fiber. We seek to fund our discretionary investments with both cash generated by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our availability under our 2016 Revolver, issuances under our CP Program, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity-related securities, including under our 2021 ATM Program. We seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital. We target a leverage ratio of approximately five times Adjusted EBITDA, subject to various factors, such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments. We may choose to increase or decrease our leverage from this target for various periods of time. Our contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of (1) Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, (2) $750 million\\xa0aggregate principal amount of\\xa03.150%\\xa0senior unsecured notes (\"3.150% Senior Notes\") and (3) principal payments on certain outstanding debt.We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our REIT status and our NOLs. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Liquidity Position. The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt as well as note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our 2021 ATM Program.(In millions of dollars)Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(a)$327\\xa0Undrawn 2016 Revolver availability(b)6,649\\xa0Total debt and other obligations (current and non-current)21,729\\xa0Total equity7,449\\xa0  (a)Inclusive of $5 million included within \"Other assets, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet.(b)Availability at any point in time is subject to certain restrictions based on the maintenance of financial covenants contained in our 2016 Credit Facility. At any point in time, we intend to maintain available commitments under our 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of outstanding Commercial Paper Notes. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.Over the next 12 months: •Our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) cash generated by our operating activities, (3) availability under our 2016 Revolver, (4) issuances under our CP Program, and (5) issuances of equity pursuant to our 2021 ATM Program. Our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt obligations of $2.1 billion (consisting of Commercial Paper Notes, the 3.150% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt), (2) cumulative common stock dividend payments expected to be at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion (see \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend\"), and (3) capital expenditures. We may also purchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, amounts available under our CP 32Program may be repaid and re-issued from time to time. During the next 12 months, while our liquidity uses are expected to exceed our cash generated by operating activities, we expect that our liquidity sources described above should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. Historically, from time to time, we have accessed the capital markets to issue debt and equity.•See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a discussion of interest rate risk and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities of $89 million for 2022 from 2021 was due primarily to growth in our core business, which was partially offset by a net decrease from changes in working capital. Changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants. We expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of changes in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.Investing Activities. Net cash used for investing activities for\\xa02022\\xa0increased\\xa0by $20 million from\\xa02021\\xa0primarily as a result of increased discretionary capital expenditures in our Fiber segment. Our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining as described below. •Discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. The expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically varies based on, among other factors: (1) the type of communications infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. Currently, construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber (including certain construction projects that may take 18 to 36 months to complete). Our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.•Sustaining capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants\\' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.33A summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows:For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021December 31, 2020(In millions of dollars)TowersFiberOtherTotalTowersFiberOtherTotalTowersFiberOtherTotalDiscretionary:Communications infrastructure improvements and other capital projects(a)$121\\xa0$1,017\\xa0$24\\xa0$1,162\\xa0$138\\xa0$905\\xa0$33\\xa0$1,076\\xa0$257\\xa0$1,179\\xa0$38\\xa0$1,474\\xa0Purchases of land interests53\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa053\\xa064\\xa02\\xa0—\\xa066\\xa064\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa064\\xa0Sustaining11\\xa041\\xa043\\xa095\\xa019\\xa049\\xa019\\xa087\\xa014\\xa053\\xa019\\xa086\\xa0Total$185\\xa0$1,058\\xa0$67\\xa0$1,310\\xa0$221\\xa0$956\\xa0$52\\xa0$1,229\\xa0$335\\xa0$1,232\\xa0$57\\xa0$1,624\\xa0 (a)Towers segment includes $48 million, $65 million and $113 million of capital expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with tenant installations and upgrades on our towers.Capital expenditures increased from 2021 to 2022 and were primarily impacted by the previously-mentioned increased discretionary capital expenditures in our Fiber segment. See \"Item\\xa07. MD&A—General Overview—Outlook Highlights\" for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2023 capital expenditures.Financing Activities. We seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities such as (in no particular order): (1) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total at least $6.26 per share over the next 12 months, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion), (2) purchasing our common stock or (3) purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. See \"Item\\xa07. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview\" and notes 7, 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2022, our financing activities predominately related to the following:•paying an aggregate of $2.6 billion in dividends on our common stock;•issuing $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our CP Program and pay related fees and expenses;•prepaying in full the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1;•redeeming in full the previously outstanding 3.849% Secured Notes;•entering into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date from June 2026 to July 2027, (2) an increase to the aggregate commitments under the 2016 Revolver from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion, (3) certain modifications to a specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with the Term SOFR pricing benchmark; and•increasing the size of our CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0\\xa0billion at any time outstanding.In 2021, our financing activities predominately related to the following:•paying an aggregate of $2.4 billion in dividends on our common stock;•issuing $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to (1) redeem all of the outstanding 5.250% Senior Notes, (2) repay a portion of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes and (3) repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan A; •issuing $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to (1) to repay in full the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class C-2022, (2) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the CP Program and (3) for general corporate purposes; and•entering into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date from June 2024 to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets and increases to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee.Incurrences, Purchases and Repayments of Debt. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \"Item\\xa07. MD&A—General Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview—Liquidity Position\" for further discussion of our recent issuances, purchases, redemptions and repayments of debt.34Common Stock. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our common stock as well as dividends declared and paid. ATM Program. In March 2021, we established the 2021 ATM Program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million. Sales under the 2021 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers\\' transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. See also note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February\\xa021, 2023, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our 2021 ATM Program. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. In July and August 2020, all of our approximately 2 million shares of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into approximately 14 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of our common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 8.8043 shares of common stock for each share of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the July and August conversions into shares of our common stock.Credit Facility. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our 2016 Credit Facility. As of February\\xa021, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $265 million and $6.7 billion in undrawn availability under our 2016 Revolver. The proceeds of our 2016 Revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.Commercial Paper Program. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our CP Program. As of February\\xa021, 2023, there was $1.2 billion outstanding under our CP Program. The proceeds from our Commercial Paper Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.Restricted Cash. Pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies\\' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Material Cash RequirementsThe following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of December\\xa031, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. These material cash requirements relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. The debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnote (b)).\\xa035(In millions of dollars)Years Ending December\\xa031,Material Cash Requirements20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalsDebt and other long-term obligations(a)$2,060\\xa0$831\\xa0$593\\xa0$2,771\\xa0$3,558\\xa0$12,078\\xa0$21,891\\xa0Interest payments on debt and other long-term obligations(b)(c)734\\xa0690\\xa0670\\xa0640\\xa0541\\xa05,613\\xa08,888\\xa0Lease obligations(d)568\\xa0561\\xa0545\\xa0538\\xa0531\\xa05,660\\xa08,403\\xa0Total material cash requirements$3,362\\xa0$2,082\\xa0$1,808\\xa0$3,949\\xa0$4,630\\xa0$23,351\\xa0$39,182\\xa0 (a)The impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 (collectively, \"Tower Revenue Notes\") is not considered. The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the Tower Revenue Notes.(b)If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2022 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $1.0 billion. We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.(c)Includes the unused commitment fees on our 2016 Credit Facility. Interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds. Each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a discussion of our interest rate risk.(d)Amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations. See also the table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.The following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms exercisable at our option, as of December\\xa031, 2022. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 36 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. See \"Item 1A.

We are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and, based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of compliance with our debt covenants.

If applicable, the consolidated interest coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.50.37Accounting and Reporting MattersCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe (1)\\xa0are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2)\\xa0require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by GAAP. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. The critical accounting policies and estimates for 2022 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Lease Accounting—Lessee. For our Towers segment, our lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under our towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site and are generally for an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at our option. We also enter into term easements and ground leases in which we prepay the entire term. For our Fiber segment, our lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to facilitate our small cells and fiber solutions. The majority of our lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at our option. We include certain renewal option periods in the lease term when we determine that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. For both our Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expense is recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require us to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of our ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, we consider all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. We calculate the straight-line expense over the contract\\'s estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that we deem reasonably certain to be exercised.We recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset (and, as applicable, a corresponding lease liability) for each of our operating leases. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term, and lease liabilities represent the present value of our future lease payments. In assessing our leases and determining our lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, we are not able to readily determine the rate implicit for our lessee arrangements and thus use our incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of our lease payments. Our ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs.We review the carrying value of our ROU assets for impairment, similar to our other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of our ROU assets.Revenue Recognition. 90% of our total revenue for 2022 consisted of site rental revenues, which are recognized on a ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from fiber solutions tenants, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of our tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant\\'s option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant\\'s option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element (such as an escalator tied to an inflation-based index) in addition to a minimum. To the extent we acquire below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure (for example with respect to small cells and fiber), we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term. Since we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the site rental revenues in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods. Our assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are 38deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which we have an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the consolidated balance sheet.As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, which represented 10% of our total revenues for 2022. Services and other revenues consists predominately of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). Our services generally have a duration of one year or less. Upon contract commencement, we assess our services to tenants and identify performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.We may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of the above performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which we believe we have transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price.The transaction price for tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to our towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under our tower installation services agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a ratable basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the tower installation service, we have one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues.Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet.Accounting for Acquisitions—General. The majority of our towers have been acquired directly or indirectly from the three largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999. We evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. For our business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Accounting for Acquisitions—Valuation\" below. The determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized. Such changes could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Acquisitions—Leases. With respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases. The evaluation of such agreements for finance or operating lease treatment previously included consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under ASC 840-10-25, namely (1) the transfer of ownership provisions, (2) the existence of bargain purchase options, (3) the length of the remaining lease term, and (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments. With respect to the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we determined that the tower leases were finance leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion, after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under ASC 840-10-25 to leases involving both land and buildings (i.e., towers). We determined that the fragmentation criteria was met, and the tower leases could be accounted for as finance leases apart from the land leases, which are accounted for as operating leases, since (1) the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25% of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and (2) the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75% of the estimated economic life of the tower assets.Accounting for Acquisitions—Valuation. As of December\\xa031, 2022, our largest asset was property and equipment (which primarily consists of communications infrastructure) followed by goodwill, operating lease ROU assets and intangible assets. Our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets.39The fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either:(1)discounted cash flow valuation methods (for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and tenant relationships or operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities acquired); or(2)estimates of replacement costs (for tangible fixed assets such as communications infrastructure).The purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements, including the amount of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. The most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are (1)\\xa0the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and (2)\\xa0the economic useful life after giving effect to age, quality, and condition. The most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are (1)\\xa0discount rates and (2)\\xa0timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding tenant renewals and cancellations. The most important estimates for measurement of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities acquired are (1) present value of our future lease payments, including whether renewals or extensions should be measured, and (2) favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms. With respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options.We record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements, pursuant to our ground leases, easements, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which certain of our communications infrastructure resides. In determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to: (1)\\xa0timing of cash flows, (2)\\xa0future costs, (3)\\xa0discount rates and (4) the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land. We do not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to our fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets—Useful Lives. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization and accretion expense that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. A substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure, the majority of which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewals).The useful lives of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. We review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships which includes assumptions regarding both (1)\\xa0tenants\\' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2)\\xa0renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure.Accounting for Long-Lived Assets—Impairment Evaluation. We review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For purposes of our Towers segment, we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets:(1)we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups; and(2)we separately pool the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate.40We first pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing, because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio. We re-evaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually. This use of grouping is based in part on (1)\\xa0our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure, (2)\\xa0the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios, and (3)\\xa0the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace. The vast majority of our site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the U.S. owned communications infrastructure group. Secondly, and separately, we pool the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate, for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related tenant relationships acquired.For purposes of our Fiber segment, we consider major U.S. markets where we have made significant investments to be the most appropriate level for purposes of grouping our long-lived assets for potential impairment evaluation.Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve (1)\\xa0a deterioration in an asset\\'s financial performance compared to historical results, (2)\\xa0a shortfall in an asset\\'s financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3)\\xa0changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset. When considering the utility of our assets, we consider events that would meaningfully impact (1)\\xa0our communications infrastructure or (2)\\xa0our tenant relationships. For example, consideration would be given to events that impact (1)\\xa0the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or (2)\\xa0our ability to derive benefit from our existing tenant relationships, including events such as tenant\\'s bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant tenant. During 2022, there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations.If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset group is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. If the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. The most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are (1)\\xa0the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and (2)\\xa0estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of tenant contracts. We could record impairments in the future if changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets, or if we changed our unit of account in the future.Approximately 2% of our total towers currently have no tenants. We continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future, primarily because of the demographics and continuing increase in demand for data in the areas around these individual towers. We estimate, based on current visibility, potential tenants on a majority of these towers. To the extent we do not believe there are long-term prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value have been exhausted, including sale of the asset, we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value.Accounting for Goodwill—Impairment Evaluation. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. We then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would be required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments (Towers and Fiber). See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairments.Deferred Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our REIT taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining NOLs.\\xa0Accordingly, the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to TRSs. Furthermore, as a result of the deduction for dividends paid, some or all of our NOLs related to our REIT may expire without utilization.\\xa0See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" for a discussion of the impact of our REIT status.\\xa041Our TRSs will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.\\xa0Our ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance, which would reduce our earnings. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. The change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows. For a further discussion of our benefit (provision) for income taxes, see \"Item 7. MD&A—Results of Operations\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP and Segment Financial MeasuresIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein and as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, we also provide (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate the performance of our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. We define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. We define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.We use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of consolidated financial performance. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other REITs, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss), net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. There are material limitations to using a measure such as Adjusted EBITDA, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. Management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, stock-based compensation expense and net (gain) loss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) is set forth below: 42Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars)202220212020Net income (loss)$1,675\\xa0$1,096\\xa0$1,056\\xa0Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):Asset write-down charges34\\xa021\\xa074\\xa0Acquisition and integration costs2\\xa01\\xa010\\xa0Depreciation, amortization and accretion1,707\\xa01,644\\xa01,608\\xa0Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments16\\xa018\\xa018\\xa0Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs699\\xa0657\\xa0689\\xa0(Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations28\\xa0145\\xa095\\xa0Interest income(3)(1)(2)Other (income) expense10\\xa021\\xa05\\xa0(Benefit) provision for income taxes16\\xa021\\xa020\\xa0Stock-based compensation expense156\\xa0131\\xa0133\\xa0Net (gain) loss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax—\\xa062\\xa0—\\xa0Adjusted EBITDA(a)$4,340\\xa0$3,816\\xa0$3,706\\xa0 (a)The above reconciliation excludes the items included in our Adjusted EBITDA definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because:•it is the primary measure used by our management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations; •although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; •we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1)\\xa0from period to period and (2)\\xa0to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results; and •it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:•as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation; •as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results; •in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management; •for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget; •as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets; •in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio; and •with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios that incorporate concepts such as, or similar to, Adjusted EBITDA. 43Item 7A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt. As of December\\xa031, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no interest rate swaps.Our interest rate risk as of December 31, 2022 relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom: •the potential refinancing of our $21.9 billion in existing debt, compared to $20.8 billion in the prior year;•our $2.7\\xa0billion of floating rate debt, compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year, representing approximately 13% and 10% of total debt, respectively; and•potential future borrowings of incremental debt, including borrowings under our 2016 Credit Facility and issuances under our CP Program.Over the past 11 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate eight times for a cumulative increase of 4.50% and has signaled further increases in the near-term, which could further increase our costs of borrowing. Prior to 2022, the Federal Reserve had not raised the federal funds rate since December 2018. See also \"Item 1a. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of risks stemming from interest rate increases.Potential Refinancing of Existing DebtOur contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, the 3.150% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt. See below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of December 31, 2022.Floating Rate DebtWe manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December\\xa031, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom, we had $2.7\\xa0billion of floating rate debt. A hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing floating rate debt of 1/4 of a percent point over a 12-month period would increase our interest expense by approximately $7 million.Potential Future Borrowings of Incremental DebtWe typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" regarding our liquidity strategy.44The following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates. The future principal payments and weighted-average interest rates are presented as of December\\xa031, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. These debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates, and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnotes (b) and (d)). See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.\\xa0Future Principal Payments and Interest Rates by the Debt Instruments\\' Contractual Year of Maturity(In millions of dollars)20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalFair\\xa0Value(a)Fixed rate debt(b)$789\\xa0$786\\xa0$532\\xa0$2,680\\xa0$2,277\\xa0$12,078\\xa0$19,142\\xa0$15,816\\xa0Average interest rate(b)(c)(d)3.2\\xa0%3.3\\xa0%1.5\\xa0%3.0\\xa0%3.5\\xa0%4.1\\xa0%3.7\\xa0%Variable rate debt(e)$1,271\\xa0(f)$45\\xa0$60\\xa0$91\\xa0$1,281\\xa0$—\\xa0$2,748\\xa0$3,738\\xa0Average interest rate(e)5.2\\xa0%4.8\\xa0%4.0\\xa0%4.0\\xa0%4.0\\xa0%—\\xa0%4.6\\xa0% (a)The fair value of our debt is based on indicative quotes, non-binding quotes from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask offers.

The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2022 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $1.0 billion.

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.47Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Towers SegmentAs described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $4,322 million in site rental revenues and $685 million in services and other revenues from its Towers segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site rental revenues from the Company\\'s tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, noncancelable term of the relevant tenant contract. The Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (i) site development services and (ii) installation services. The transaction price for the Company\\'s tower installation services consists of amounts for (i) permanent improvements to the Company\\'s towers that represent a lease component and (ii) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company\\'s tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for the Towers segment is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to tenant contracts and installation service agreements. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to revenue recognition for Towers. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification of the contractual terms by examining tenant contracts and installation service agreements on a test basis and (ii) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on contractual terms and estimated lease term for selected tenant contracts and installation service agreements./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaFebruary 24, 2023We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2011.48CROWN CASTLE INC.

(formerly, Crown Castle International Corp.) and its predecessor, as applicable (together, \"CCI\"), and their subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as the \"Company.\" All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As used herein, the term \"including,\" and any variation thereof, means \"including without limitation.\" The use of the word \"or\" herein is not exclusive. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to \"U.S.\" are to the United States of America and Puerto Rico, collectively.The Company owns, operates and leases shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., including (1) towers and other structures, such as rooftops (collectively, \"towers\"), and (2) fiber primarily supporting small cell networks (\"small cells\") and fiber solutions. The Company\\'s towers, small cells and fiber assets are collectively referred to herein as \"communications infrastructure,\" and the Company\\'s customers on its communications infrastructure are referred to herein as \"tenants.\" The Company\\'s core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). The Company\\'s operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. See note 14.Approximately 53% of the Company\\'s towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). The Company has the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See notes 4 and 13.As part of the Company\\'s effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). The Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Company has certain taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"). See note 9.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe following is a discussion of the Company\\'s significant accounting policies in effect for the year ended December 31, 2022.Restricted CashRestricted cash represents (1) the cash held in reserve by the indenture trustees pursuant to the indenture governing certain of the Company\\'s debt instruments, (2) cash securing performance obligations such as letters of credit, as well as (3) any other cash whose use is limited by contractual provisions. The restriction of rental cash receipts is a critical feature of certain of the Company\\'s debt instruments, due to the applicable indenture trustee\\'s ability to utilize the restricted cash for the payment of (1)\\xa0debt service costs, (2)\\xa0ground rents, (3)\\xa0real estate or personal property taxes, (4)\\xa0insurance premiums related to towers, (5)\\xa0other assessments by governmental authorities and potential environmental remediation costs, or (6)\\xa0a portion of advance rents from tenants. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See note 16 for a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.53NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Receivables AllowanceAn allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable. The Company uses judgment in estimating this allowance and considers historical collections, current credit status, or contractual provisions. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged either to \"Site rental costs of operations\" or to \"Services and other costs of operations,\" as appropriate, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible.Lease AccountingGeneral. The Company evaluates whether a contract meets the definition of a lease whenever a contract grants a party the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To the extent the identified asset is able to be shared among multiple parties, the Company has determined that one party does not have control of the identified asset and the contract is not considered a lease. The Company accounts for contracts that do not meet the definition of a lease under other relevant accounting guidance (such as ASC 606 for revenue from contracts with customers).Lessee. For its Tower segment, the Company\\'s lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site, generally contain an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at the Company\\'s option. The Company also enters into term easements and ground leases in which it prepays the entire term. For its Fiber segment, the Company\\'s lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to support the Company\\'s small cells and fiber solutions.The majority of the Company\\'s lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at the Company\\'s option. The Company includes renewal option periods in its calculation of the estimated lease term when it determines the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. When such renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain, the estimated lease term determined under ASC 842 will be greater than the non-cancelable term of the contractual arrangement. Although certain renewal periods are included in the estimated lease term, the Company would have the ability to terminate or elect to not renew a particular lease if business conditions warrant such a decision.The Company classifies its lessee arrangements at inception as either operating leases or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the five criteria described above for finance lease classification is met. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets associated with operating leases are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. Current and long-term portions of lease liabilities related to operating leases are included in \"Current portion of operating lease liabilities\" and \"Operating lease liabilities\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet, respectively. ROU assets represent the Company\\'s right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\\'s present value of its future lease payments. In assessing its leases and determining its lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, the Company is not able to readily determine the rate implicit for its lessee arrangements, and thus uses its incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company\\'s ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs. For both the Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company\\'s ground lease and fiber lease agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company calculates the straight-line expense over the contract\\'s estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that the Company deems reasonably certain to be exercised.Lease agreements may also contain provisions for a contingent payment based on (1) the revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset, (2) the change in CPI or (3) the usage of the leased asset. The Company\\'s contingent payments are considered variable lease payments and are (1) not included in the initial measurement of 54NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)the ROU asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and (2) recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.ROU assets associated with finance leases are included in \"Property and equipment, net\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities associated with finance leases are included in \"Current maturities of debt and other obligations\" and \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. For both its Towers and Fiber segments, the Company measures the lease liability for finance leases using the effective interest method. The initial lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the liability and decreased to reflect payments made during the period. Interest on the lease liability is determined each period during the lease term as the amount that results in a constant periodic discount rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The Company depreciates ROU assets for finance leases on a ratable basis over the applicable lease term.The Company reviews the carrying value of its ROU assets for impairment, similar to its other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of its ROU assets.Lessor. The Company\\'s lessor arrangements primarily include tenant contracts for dedicated space (including dedicated fiber) on its shared communications infrastructure. The Company classifies its leases at inception as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. A lease is classified as a sales-type lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying assets or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. Furthermore, when none of the above criteria is met, a lease is classified as a direct financing lease if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the present value of the of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee, that is not already reflected in the lease payments, equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying asset and (2) it is probable that the lessor will collect the lease payments plus any amount necessary to satisfy a residual value guarantee. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not qualify as a sales-type or direct financing lease. Currently, the Company classifies all of its lessor arrangements as operating leases.Site rental revenues from the Company’s lessor arrangements are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of the Company\\'s tenant contracts contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating straight-line site rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions. Certain of the Company\\'s arrangements with tenants in its Fiber segment contain both lease and non-lease components. In such circumstances, the Company has determined (1) the timing and pattern of transfer for the lease and non-lease component are the same and (2) the stand-alone lease component would be classified as an operating lease. As such, the Company has aggregated certain non-lease components with lease components and has determined that the lease components (generally dedicated fiber) represent the predominant component of the arrangement.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment includes land owned in fee and perpetual easements for land, which have no definite life. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Depreciation for the majority of communications infrastructure is computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewal periods). Additions and permanent improvements to the Company\\'s communications infrastructure are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed.Labor and interest costs incurred directly related to the construction of certain property and equipment are capitalized during the construction phase of projects. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $265 million, $238\\xa0million and $270 million in capitalized labor costs, respectively. The carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.55NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Abandonments and write-offs of property and equipment are recorded to \"Asset write-down charges\" on the Company\\'s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and were $39 million, $19 million and $77 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Asset write-down charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the write-off of property and equipment of approximately $63\\xa0million which, following the 2020 Cancellation, was deemed to have no alternative future use. See note 15 for further information regarding the 2020 Cancellation.Asset Retirement ObligationsPursuant to its ground lease, easement, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, the Company records obligations to perform asset retirement activities, including requirements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space on which certain of its communications infrastructure is located. The Company does not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to its fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Asset retirement obligations are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. The liability accretes as a result of the passage of time and the related accretion expense is included in \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" on the Company\\'s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as an additional carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of such asset.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price for an acquired business over the allocated value of the related net assets. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. The Company\\'s reporting units are the same as its operating segments (Towers and Fiber). The Company then performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of October\\xa01, 2022, which resulted in no impairments.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are included in \"Site rental contracts and tenant relationships, net\" and \"Other intangible assets, net\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet and predominately consist of the estimated fair value of site rental contracts and tenant relationships or other contractual rights, such as trademarks, that are recorded in conjunction with acquisitions. Site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are comprised of (1)\\xa0the current term of the existing leases, (2)\\xa0the high rate of tenant retention, and (3)\\xa0any associated relationships that are expected to generate value following the expiration of all renewal periods under existing leases. The useful lives of intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit the Company and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships, which includes assumptions regarding both (1)\\xa0tenants\\' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2)\\xa0renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite useful lives will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company has a dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets. First, the Company pools site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets with the related communications infrastructure assets into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for 56NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)impairment testing. Second and separately, the Company pools the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate. If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset.Deferred CreditsDeferred credits are included in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet and consist of the estimated fair value of below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on acquired communications infrastructure that are amortized to site rental revenues.Fair value for these deferred credits represents the difference between (1) the stated contractual payments to be made pursuant to the in-place lease and (2) management\\'s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding lease. Deferred credits are measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining economic lease term considering renewal provisions or economics associated with those renewal provisions, to the extent applicable. Deferred credits are amortized over their respected estimated lease terms at the time of acquisition.Deferred Financing CostsThird-party costs incurred to obtain financing, with the exception of costs incurred related to revolving lines of credit, are deferred and are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability in \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" on the Company\\'s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the related debt liability. Third party costs incurred to obtain financing through a revolving line of credit are deferred and are included in \"Other assets, net\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" on the Company\\'s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement (as defined in note 7).Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Typically, providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site Rental Revenues. Site rental revenues from the Company\\'s tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, which generally ranges from five to 15 years for wireless tenants and three to 20 years for the Company\\'s fiber solutions tenants (including from organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of the tenant contract. Certain of the Company\\'s tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant\\'s option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant\\'s option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating straight-line rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company\\'s assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet.Services and Other Revenues. As part of the Company’s effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. Upon contract commencement, the Company assesses its services to tenants and identifies performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.57NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The Company may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of these performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which the Company believes it has transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price. The volume and mix of site development services may vary among contracts and may include a combination of some or all of the above performance obligations. Payments generally are due within 45 to 60 days and generally do not contain variable-consideration provisions. The transaction price for the Company\\'s tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to the Company\\'s towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company\\'s tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues on the Company consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of the Company’s services generally have a duration of one year or less.Additional Information on Revenues. As of January 1, 2022 and\\xa0December 31, 2022, a total of\\xa0$2.6 billion\\xa0and\\xa0$2.3 billion, respectively,\\xa0of unrecognized revenue was reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended\\xa0December 31, 2022, approximately\\xa0$668 million\\xa0of the January 1, 2022 unrecognized revenue balance was recognized as revenue. As of January 1, 2021,\\xa0a total of $2.8 billion\\xa0of unrecognized revenue was reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended\\xa0December 31,\\xa02021, approximately\\xa0$595 million\\xa0of the January 1, 2021 unrecognized revenue balance was recognized as revenue.See note\\xa03\\xa0for further discussion regarding the Company’s revenues.Costs of OperationsApproximately half of the Company\\'s site rental costs of operations expenses consist of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses, property taxes, repairs and maintenance expenses, employee compensation or related benefit costs, or utilities. Generally, the ground leases for land are specific to each site and are for an initial term of five years and are renewable for pre-determined periods. The Company also enters into term easements and ground leases in which it prepays the entire term in advance. Fiber access expenses primarily consist of leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate the Company\\'s communications infrastructure. Ground lease and fiber access expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company\\'s ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, the Company considers all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company\\'s liability related to straight-line expense is included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet. The Company\\'s assets related to prepaid agreements is included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet.Services and other costs of operations predominately consist of third-party service providers such as contractors and professional services firms and, to a lesser extent, internal labor costs, associated with the Company\\'s site development and installation services. The Company\\'s costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of associated performance obligations of $43\\xa0million and $65\\xa0million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet.The Company recognized $20\\xa0million as costs of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a reduction in staffing completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Such costs were comprised of employee severance payments and termination benefits and primarily impacted the Company\\'s Fiber segment.58NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Acquisitions and Integration CostsDirect or incremental costs related to a potential or completed business combination transaction are expensed as incurred. Such costs are predominately comprised of severance, retention bonuses payable to employees of an acquired enterprise, temporary employees to assist with the integration of the acquired operations, fees paid for services (such as consulting, accounting, legal, or engineering reviews), and any other costs directly associated with the transaction. These business combination costs are included in \"Acquisition and integration costs\" on the Company\\'s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For those transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.Stock-based CompensationRestricted Stock Units. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for unvested restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of RSUs for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered is recognized in the period of the change in the estimate. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the awards vest. A discussion of the Company\\'s valuation techniques and related assumptions and estimates used to measure the Company\\'s stock-based compensation is as follows:Valuation. The fair value of RSUs without market conditions is determined based on the number of shares relating to such RSUs and the quoted price of the Company\\'s common stock at the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs with market conditions granted using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Company\\'s determination of the fair value of RSUs with market conditions on the date of grant is affected by its common stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex or subjective variables. The determination of fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation requires the input of subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results.Amortization Method. The Company amortizes the fair value of all RSUs on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting tranche of the award (graded vesting schedule) over the requisite service periods. Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock.Expected Dividend Rate. The expected dividend rate at the date of grant is based on the then-current dividend yield.Risk-Free Rate. The Company bases the risk-free rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.Forfeitures. The Company uses historical award forfeiture data and management\\'s judgment about the future employee turnover rates to estimate the number of shares for which the requisite service period will not be rendered.Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing CostsThe components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are as follows:\\xa0Years Ended December\\xa031,\\xa0202220212020Interest expense on debt obligations$685\\xa0$644\\xa0$683\\xa0Amortization of deferred financing costs and adjustments on long-term debt26\\xa025\\xa023\\xa0Capitalized interest(12)(12)(17)Total$699\\xa0$657\\xa0$689\\xa0The Company amortizes deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums over the estimated term of the related borrowing using the effective interest yield method. Deferred financing costs and discounts are generally presented as a direct reduction to the related debt obligation on the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet.\\xa059NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Income TaxesThe Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its net taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders. The Company also may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income and (2) taxes related to the TRSs. In addition, the Company could under certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. Additionally, the Company has included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located. The Company\\'s foreign assets and operations (including its tower operations in Puerto Rico) are subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether they are included in a TRS or not. For its REIT conversion and certain subsequent acquisitions into the REIT, the Company will be subject to a federal corporate level tax rate (currently 21%) on any gain recognized from the sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally 5 years) after the transfer date up to the amount of the built in gain that existed on the transfer date, which is based upon the fair market value of those assets in excess of the Company\\'s tax basis on the transfer date.\\xa0This gain can be offset by any remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\").For the Company\\'s TRSs, the Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\\'s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that the asset will not be realized. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets each quarter and based upon projections of future taxable income, reversing deferred tax liabilities or other known events that are expected to affect future taxable income, records a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the \"more likely than not\" realization threshold. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based upon changes in facts and circumstances that impact the recoverability of the asset.The Company recognizes a tax position if it is \"more likely than not\" that it will be sustained upon examination. The tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the benefit (provision) for income taxes. As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not recorded any material penalties related to its income tax positions. See note 9.Per Share InformationBasic net income (loss), per common share, excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, diluted net income (loss), per common share, is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus any potential dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units as determined under the treasury stock method and (2) conversion of the Company\\'s previously outstanding 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (\"6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock\"), as applicable, as determined under the if-converted method.60NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations is shown in the table below. \\xa0Years Ended December\\xa031,\\xa0202220212020Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,675\\xa0$1,158\\xa0$1,056\\xa0Dividends/distributions on preferred stock—\\xa0—\\xa0(57)Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to CCI common stockholders for basic and diluted computations$1,675\\xa0$1,158\\xa0$999\\xa0Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$—\\xa0$(62)$—\\xa0Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders$1,675\\xa0$1,096\\xa0$999\\xa0Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (in millions):Basic weighted-average number of common stock outstanding433\\xa0432\\xa0423\\xa0Effect of assumed dilution from potential issuance of common shares relating to RSUs1\\xa02\\xa02\\xa0Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding434\\xa0434\\xa0425\\xa0Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders, per common share:Income (loss) from continuing operations, basic$3.87\\xa0$2.68\\xa0$2.36\\xa0Income (loss) from discontinued operations, basic—\\xa0(0.14)—\\xa0Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders—basic$3.87\\xa0$2.54\\xa0$2.36\\xa0Income (loss) from continuing operations, diluted$3.86\\xa0$2.67\\xa0$2.35\\xa0Income (loss) from discontinued operations, diluted—\\xa0(0.14)—\\xa0Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders—diluted$3.86\\xa0$2.53\\xa0$2.35\\xa0Dividends/distributions declared per share of common stock$5.98\\xa0$5.46\\xa0$4.93\\xa0For the year ended\\xa0December 31, 2020, 14\\xa0million common share equivalents related to the Company\\'s previously outstanding 6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock were excluded from the dilutive common shares, because the impact of the conversion of such preferred stock would be anti-dilutive based on the Company\\'s common stock price at the end of each respective year. See note 10 for further discussion of the Company\\'s previously outstanding 6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock. Fair ValuesThe Company\\'s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are (1) Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active and accessible markets, (2) Level 2 — observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data, and (3) Level 3 — unobservable inputs and are not corroborated by market data. The Company evaluates fair value hierarchy level classifications quarterly, and transfers between levels are effective at the end of the quarterly period.The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate the carrying values. The Company determines the fair value of its debt securities based on indicative, non-binding quotes from brokers. Quotes from brokers require judgment and are based on the brokers\\' interpretation of market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices or quotes from active markets if available. There were no changes since December\\xa031, 2021 in the Company\\'s valuation techniques used to measure fair values. See note 8 for a further discussion of fair values.\\xa061NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsNo accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 had a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedNo new accounting pronouncements issued\\xa0but not yet adopted are expected to have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.3.RevenuesThe following table is a summary of the contracted amounts owed to the Company by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts in effect as of December\\xa031, 2022.

In January 2016, the Company established the 2016 Credit Facility, which was originally comprised of (1) a $2.5 billion 2016 Revolver maturing in January 2021, (2) a $2.0 billion 2016 Term Loan A maturing in January 2021 and (3) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility (\"364-Day Facility\") maturing in January 2017.\\xa0The Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 Credit Facility (1) to repay the then outstanding senior credit facility originally established in January 2012 and (2) for general corporate purposes. In February 2016, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the February 2016 Senior Notes (as defined below) offering to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the then outstanding 364-Day Facility. In February 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and (2) extend the maturity of both the 2016 Term Loan A and the 2016 Revolver to January 2022. In August 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $3.5 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to August 2022.In June 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $4.25 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2023. In June 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $5.0 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2024.In June 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread (\"Spread\") and unused commitment fee (\"Commitment Fee\") percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets (\"Targets\") and increases to the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds (\"Thresholds\") and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to an upward adjustment of up to 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively, if the Company fails to achieve the Thresholds. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to a downward adjustment of up to 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively, if the Company achieves the Targets. In January 2022, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of December 31, 2021, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentages were reduced for 2022.In July 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to July 2027, (2) an increase to the commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $7.0\\xa0billion, (3) certain modifications to the specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with a Term SOFR pricing benchmark.In January 2023, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of December 31, 2022, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage reductions applied in January 2022 were maintained for 2023.66NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Commercial Paper Program. In April 2019, the Company established a commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\"). Commercial Paper Notes may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with an aggregate principal amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time originally not to exceed $1.0 billion. The net proceeds of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes, when outstanding, may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper Notes are issued under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, can be issued at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. At any point in time, the Company intends to maintain available commitments under its 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. While any outstanding commercial paper issuances generally have short-term maturities, the Company classifies the outstanding issuances as long-term based on its ability and intent to refinance the outstanding issuances on a long-term basis.In March 2022, the Company increased the size of the CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0\\xa0billion at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net issuances of $1.2 billion under the CP Program. Securitized DebtThe Tower Revenue Notes and the Secured Notes, Series 2009-1, Class A-2 (\"2009 Securitized Notes\") (collectively, \"Securitized Debt\") are obligations of special purpose entities and their direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an \"issuer\"), all of which are wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of CCI. The Tower Revenue Notes and 2009 Securitized Notes are governed by separate indentures. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes and 2018 Tower Revenue Notes (each as defined below) are governed by one indenture and consist of multiple series of notes, each with its own anticipated repayment date.In May 2015, the Company issued $1.0\\xa0billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2015 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company\\'s then outstanding Tower Revenue Notes. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $300\\xa0million aggregate principal amount of 3.222% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2022 and a final maturity date of May 2042 (\"Series 2015-1 Notes\") and (2) $700\\xa0million aggregate principal amount of 3.663% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2025 and a final maturity date of May 2045 (\"Series 2015-2 Notes\"). The Company primarily used the net proceeds of the 2015 Tower Revenue Notes, together with proceeds received from the Company\\'s sale of the formerly 77.6% owned subsidiary that operated towers in Australia (\"CCAL\"), to (1) repay $250 million aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding August 2010 Tower Revenue Notes, (2) repay all of the then outstanding WCP Secured Wireless Site Contracts Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1 (\"WCP Securitized Notes\"), (3) repay portions of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility and (4) pay related fees and expenses. In June 2021, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2021 Senior Notes (as defined below) offering to repay in whole the Series 2015-1 Notes.In July 2018, the Company issued $1.0 billion\\xa0aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2018 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company\\'s existing Tower Revenue Notes. The 2018 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $250 million\\xa0aggregate principal amount of\\xa03.720%\\xa0senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2023 and a final maturity of July 2043 (\"Series 2018-1 Notes\") and (2) $750 million\\xa0aggregate principal amount of\\xa04.241%\\xa0senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2028 and a final maturity of July 2048 (\"Series 2018-2 Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2010-6 and to pay related fees and expenses. In addition to the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes described above, in connection with Exchange Act risk retention requirements (\"Risk Retention Rules\"), an indirect subsidiary of the Company issued and a majority-owned affiliate of the Company purchased approximately\\xa0$53 million\\xa0of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1, Class R-2028 to retain an eligible horizontal residual interest (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes. In March 2022, the Company prepaid the Series 2018-1 Notes.The Securitized Debt is paid solely from the cash flows generated by the operation of the towers held directly and indirectly by the issuers of the respective Securitized Debt. The Securitized Debt is secured by, among other things, (1)\\xa0a security interest in substantially all of the applicable issuers\\' assignable personal property, (2)\\xa0a pledge of the equity interests in each applicable issuer and (3)\\xa0a security interest in the applicable issuers\\' leases with tenants to lease tower space (space licenses). The governing instruments of two indirect subsidiaries (\"Crown Atlantic\" and \"Crown GT\") of the issuers of the 67NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Tower Revenue Notes generally prevent them from issuing debt and granting liens on their assets without the approval of a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. Consequently, while distributions paid by Crown Atlantic and Crown GT will service the Tower Revenue Notes, the Tower Revenue Notes are not obligations of, nor are the Tower Revenue Notes secured by the cash flows or any other assets of, Crown Atlantic and Crown GT. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the Securitized Debt was collateralized with personal property and equipment with an aggregate net book value of approximately $813 million, exclusive of Crown Atlantic and Crown GT personal property and equipment.The excess cash flows from the issuers of the Securitized Debt, after the payment of principal, interest, reserves, expenses and management fees, are distributed to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (\"DSCR\") (as defined in the applicable governing loan agreement) as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to a certain level, then all excess cash flow of the issuers of the applicable debt instrument will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Company. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Company until the DSCR exceeds a certain level for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the DSCR falls below a certain level as of the end of any calendar quarter, then all cash on deposit in the reserve account along with future excess cash flows of the issuers will be applied to prepay the debt with applicable prepayment consideration.The Company may repay the Securitized Debt in whole or in part at any time, provided in each case that such prepayment is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration. The Securitized Debt has covenants and restrictions customary for rated securitizations, including provisions prohibiting the issuers from incurring additional indebtedness or further encumbering their assets.

Of the shares remaining available for future issuance, approximately 2 million shares may be issued pursuant to outstanding RSUs granted under the 2013 LTIP.Restricted Stock UnitsThe Company issues RSUs to certain executives and employees. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company\\'s common stock subject to satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms. The RSUs granted to certain executives and employees include (1)\\xa0annual performance awards that generally include provisions for forfeiture by the employee if certain market performance of the Company\\'s common stock (as further described below) is not achieved, (2)\\xa0new hire or promotional awards that generally contain only service-based vesting conditions and (3)\\xa0other awards related to specific business initiatives or compensation objectives including retention and merger integration.

Certain RSU agreements contain provisions that result in forfeiture by the employee of any unvested shares in the event that the Company\\'s common stock does not achieve certain performance targets. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the market performance target is achieved.

The explosion resulted in two fatalities, physical injuries (some of which were serious), and property damage to surrounding buildings and businesses. Currently, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an outcome or estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these lawsuits.75NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Other MattersThe Company is involved in various other claims, assessments, lawsuits or proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such other matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs or losses that may be incurred, if any, management believes the adverse resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s consolidated financial position or results of operations. Additionally, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are contingently liable for commitments or performance guarantees arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain letters of credit or surety bonds. See note 13 for a discussion of operating lease commitments. In addition, see note 4 for a discussion of the Company\\'s option to purchase approximately 53% of its towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options.13.LeasesLessor Tenant LeasesSee note 3 for further information regarding the contractual amounts owed to the Company pursuant to tenant contracts in effect as of December\\xa031, 2022 and other information.Lessee Operating LeasesThe components of the Company\\'s operating lease expense are as follows:Years Ended December 31,202220212020Lease cost:Operating lease expense(a)$660\\xa0$646\\xa0$640\\xa0Variable lease expense(b)175\\xa0164\\xa0153\\xa0Total lease expense(c)$835\\xa0$810\\xa0$793\\xa0 (a)Represents the Company\\'s operating lease expense related to its ROU assets for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020.(b)Represents the Company\\'s expense related to contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Such contingencies are recognized as expense in the period they are resolved.(c)Excludes those direct operating expenses accounted for pursuant to accounting guidance outside the scope of ASC 842.Lessee Finance LeasesThe vast majority of the Company\\'s finance leases are related to the towers subject to prepaid master lease agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), and are recorded as \"Property and equipment, net\" on the consolidated balance sheet. See note 4 for further discussion of the Company\\'s prepaid master lease agreements. Finance leases and associated leasehold improvements related to gross property and equipment and accumulated depreciation were $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December\\xa031, 2022. Finance leases and associated leasehold improvements related to gross property and equipment and accumulated depreciation were $4.3\\xa0billion and $2.5\\xa0billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. For the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $182 million, $200\\xa0million and $211\\xa0million, respectively, to \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" related to finance leases. Other Lessee InformationAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the Company\\'s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for operating leases were 16 years and 3.6%, respectively.76NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The following table is a summary of the Company\\'s maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\\xa031, 2022:Years Ending December 31,ThereafterTotal undiscounted lease paymentsLess: Imputed interestTotal operating lease liabilities20232024202520262027Operating leases(a)$568\\xa0$561\\xa0$545\\xa0$538\\xa0$531\\xa0$5,660\\xa0$8,403\\xa0$(2,172)$6,231\\xa0 (a)Excludes the Company\\'s contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from the Company\\'s operating lease liability. Such contingencies are recognized as expense in the period they are resolved.14.Operating Segments and Concentrations of Credit RiskOperating SegmentsThe Company\\'s operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. The Towers segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company\\'s more than 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The Towers segment also reflects certain ancillary services relating to the Company\\'s towers, predominately consisting of site development services and installation services. The Fiber segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company\\'s approximately (1) 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (2) 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cells and fiber solutions geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The measurements of profit or loss used by the Company\\'s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") to evaluate the performance of its operating segments are (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin and (3) segment operating profit. The Company defines segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. The Company defines segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately.Costs that are directly attributable to Towers and Fiber are assigned to those respective segments. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in the Company\\'s segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. The \"Other\" column (1) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest income, other income (expense), income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense, and (2) reconciles segment operating profit to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segment’s performance. The \"Other\" total assets balance includes corporate assets such as cash and cash equivalents which have not been allocated to specific segments. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company\\'s operating segments.77NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Year Ended December 31, 2022TowersFiberOtherConsolidatedTotalSegment site rental revenues$4,322\\xa0$1,967\\xa0$6,289\\xa0Segment services and other revenues685\\xa012\\xa0697\\xa0Segment revenues5,007\\xa01,979\\xa06,986\\xa0Segment site rental costs of operations918\\xa0650\\xa01,568\\xa0Segment services and other costs of operations447\\xa09\\xa0456\\xa0Segment costs of operations(a)(b)1,365\\xa0659\\xa02,024\\xa0Segment site rental gross margin3,404\\xa01,317\\xa04,721\\xa0Segment services and other gross margin238\\xa03\\xa0241\\xa0Segment selling, general and administrative expenses(b)115\\xa0190\\xa0305\\xa0Segment operating profit (loss)3,527\\xa01,130\\xa04,657\\xa0Other selling, general and administrative expenses(b)$317\\xa0317\\xa0Stock-based compensation expense156\\xa0156\\xa0Depreciation, amortization and accretion1,707\\xa01,707\\xa0Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs699\\xa0699\\xa0Other (income) expenses to reconcile to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes(c)87\\xa087\\xa0Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes$1,691\\xa0Capital expenditures$185\\xa0$1,058\\xa0$67\\xa0$1,310\\xa0Total assets (at year end)$22,210\\xa0$16,010\\xa0$701\\xa0$38,921\\xa0Total goodwill (at year end)$5,127\\xa0$4,958\\xa0$—\\xa0$10,085\\xa0 (a)Exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion shown separately.(b)Segment costs of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 excludes (1) stock-based compensation expense of $28 million and (2) prepaid lease purchase price adjustments of $16 million.

On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint announced the completion of their previously disclosed merger.Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivables. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents by maintaining such deposits at high credit quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions. The Company\\'s restricted cash is predominately held and directed by a trustee (see note 2). The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues from tenants in the wireless industry. The Company also has a concentration in its volume of business with T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless or their agents that accounts for a significant portion of the Company\\'s revenues, receivables and deferred site rental receivables. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its tenants, the use of tenant leases with contractually determinable payment terms or proactive management of past due balances.79NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 15.Other Operating IncomeDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, T-Mobile notified the Company that it was cancelling approximately 5,700 small cells initially contracted with Sprint (\"2020 Cancellation\") prior to its merger with T-Mobile. The majority of the cancelled small cells were not yet constructed and, upon completion, would have been located at the same locations as other T-Mobile small cells. The 2020 Cancellation resulted in T-Mobile accelerating payment of all contractual rental obligations associated with the approximately 5,700 small cells as well as the payment of capital costs incurred to date.The Company received approximately $308\\xa0million from T-Mobile pursuant to the 2020 Cancellation, and recognized receipt of this payment as \"Other operating income\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Company previously received upfront payments from Sprint for certain of the small cells subject to the 2020 Cancellation, which the Company previously recorded as \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on its consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the 2020 Cancellation, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized the unamortized portion of such upfront payments, or approximately $54\\xa0million, as \"Other operating income\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020.See also note 2 for a discussion of the Company\\'s separate evaluation and write-off during the year ended December 31, 2020 of property and equipment previously recorded related to the cancelled small cells.16.Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe following table is a summary of the supplemental cash flow information during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \\xa0Years Ended December\\xa031,\\xa0202220212020Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information:Cash payments related to operating lease liabilities(a)$560\\xa0$550\\xa0$538\\xa0Interest paid684\\xa0661\\xa0653\\xa0Income taxes paid 10\\xa020\\xa019\\xa0Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities:New ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities191\\xa0573\\xa0627\\xa0Increase (decrease) in accounts payable for purchases of property and equipment(5)3\\xa027\\xa0Purchase of property and equipment under finance leases and installment land purchases28\\xa025\\xa033\\xa0 (a)Excludes the Company\\'s contingent payments pursuant to operating leases, which are recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.The reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within various lines on the consolidated balance sheet to amounts reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows is shown below.As of December\\xa031,202220212020Cash and cash equivalents$156\\xa0$292\\xa0$232\\xa0Restricted cash, current166\\xa0169\\xa0144\\xa0Restricted cash reported within other assets, net5\\xa05\\xa05\\xa0Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$327\\xa0$466\\xa0$381\\xa0 17.Subsequent EventsCommon Stock DividendOn February 7, 2023, the Company\\'s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.565 per common share.

Based upon their evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December\\xa031, 2022, the Company\\'s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\\'s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company\\'s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.(b) Management\\'s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\\'s CEO and CFO, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2022. Based on the Company\\'s assessment, management has concluded that the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\\xa031, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.The effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K.(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere have not been any changes in the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.(d) Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsBecause of its inherent limitations, the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.82Item 9B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Other InformationOn February 23, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective upon filing, to correct an error contained in the Certificate of Amendment to the Charter filed on May 20, 2022 (\"Amendment\") in connection with an increase of authorized shares. The Amendment inadvertently included an incorrect number of the Company’s total authorized shares of stock and shares of common stock that were previously approved by the board of directors and stockholders.The foregoing summary description of the Certificate of Correction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Correction, filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference.

We refer to our towers, small cells and fiber assets collectively as \"communications infrastructure,\" and to our customers on our communications infrastructure as \"tenants.\" Our operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber, which includes both small cells and fiber solutions. Our core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to our shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). We seek to increase our site rental revenues by adding more tenants on our shared communications infrastructure, which we expect to result in significant incremental cash flows due to our low incremental operating costs. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Over the last two decades, we have assembled a leading portfolio of towers predominately through acquisitions from large wireless carriers or their predecessors. More recently, both through acquisitions and new construction of small cells and fiber, we have extended our communications infrastructure presence by investing significantly in our Fiber segment. Through our product offerings of towers and small cells, we seek to provide a comprehensive solution to enable our wireless tenants to expand coverage and capacity for their wireless networks. Furthermore, within our Fiber segment, we seek to generate cash flow growth and stockholder return by deploying our fiber for both small cells' and fiber solutions' tenants.Approximately 56% and 71% of our towers are located in the 50 and 100 largest U.S. basic trading areas (\"BTAs\"), respectively. Our towers have a significant presence in each of the top 100 BTAs. We derive approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we own, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, and we derive approximately 60% of our towers site rental gross margin from towers located on land that we lease, sublease, manage or license. The contracts for the land under our towers have an average total remaining life of approximately 36 years (including all renewal terms exercisable at our option), weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. The majority of our small cells and fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas, including a presence within every major U.S. market. The vast majority of our fiber assets are located on public rights-of-way. Our largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless, which collectively accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2022 consolidated site rental revenues. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. Site rental revenues represented 90% of our 2022 consolidated net revenues, of which 69% and 31% were from our Towers segment and Fiber segment, respectively. Within our Fiber segment, 68% and 32% of our 2022 site rental revenues related to fiber solutions and small cells, respectively. The vast majority of our site rental revenues are of a recurring nature and are derived from long-term tenant contracts. See \"Item 1. Business—The Company\" for further information. As of December 31, 2022, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants' option, our tenant contracts had a weighted-average remaining life of approximately six years and represented $40 billion of expected future cash inflows. As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). StrategyAs a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our existing portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per-share results. The key elements of our strategy are to:•Grow cash flows from our existing communications infrastructure. We are focused on maximizing the recurring site rental cash flows generated from providing our tenants with long-term access to our shared infrastructure assets, 4which we believe is the core driver of value for our stockholders. Tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment (collectively, \"tenant additions\") enable our tenants to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for data, while generating high incremental returns for our business. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells through our shared communications infrastructure model provide a comprehensive, efficient and cost-effective solution for our wireless tenants' growing networks. Additionally, we believe our ability to share our fiber assets across multiple tenants to both deploy small cells and offer fiber solutions allows us to generate cash flows and increase stockholder return.•Return cash generated by operating activities to common stockholders in the form of dividends. We believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities appropriately provides common stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected long-term stockholder value while still allowing us to retain sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth. We believe this decision reflects the translation of the high-quality, long-term contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to common stockholders.•Invest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. In addition to adding tenants to existing communications infrastructure, we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. These investments include constructing and acquiring new communications infrastructure that we expect will generate future cash flow growth and attractive long-term returns by adding tenants to those assets over time. Our historical investments have included the following (in no particular order):◦construction of towers, fiber and small cells; ◦acquisitions of towers, fiber and small cells; ◦acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); ◦improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; ◦purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and ◦purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. Our strategy to create long-term stockholder value is based on our belief that there will be considerable future demand for our communications infrastructure based on the location of our assets and the rapid and continuing growth in the demand for data. We believe that such demand for our communications infrastructure will continue, will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure, and will create other growth opportunities for us, such as demand for newly constructed or acquired communications infrastructure, as described above. Further, we seek to augment the long-term value creation associated with growing our recurring site rental cash flows by offering certain ancillary site development and installation services within our Towers segment.REIT StatusWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and, therefore, are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. We may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income or assets, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income, (2) taxes related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"), (3) franchise taxes, (4) property taxes and (5) transfer taxes. In addition, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. For taxable years beginning before 2026, qualified REIT dividends (within the meaning of Section 199A(e)(3) of the Code) constitute a part of a non-corporate taxpayer's \"qualified business income amount\" and thus our non-corporate U.S. stockholders may be eligible to take a qualified business income deduction in an amount equal to 20% of such dividends received from us. Without further legislative action, the 20% deduction applicable to qualified REIT dividends will expire on January 1, 2026.The vast majority of our assets and revenues are in the REIT. See notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.Our foreign assets and operations (including our tower operations in Puerto Rico) most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether or not they are included in a TRS.5To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, after the utilization of our NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) (see notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements). Our quarterly common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for risks associated with our REIT status. Industry OverviewConsumer demand for data continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and increased penetration of bandwidth-intensive devices. This increase in data consumption is driven by factors such as growth in (1) mobile entertainment (such as mobile video, mobile applications and social networking), (2) mobile internet usage (supporting web browsing and trends in telehealth, remote working, online learning and other remote communications), (3) machine-to-machine applications or the \"Internet of Things\" (such as connected cars and smart city technologies), and (4) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications). As a result, consumer wireless devices are trending toward bandwidth-intensive devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other emerging and embedded devices, and U.S. wireless carriers are among the first carriers in the world to begin offering commercial 5th Generation (\"5G\") mobile cellular communications services to further support such growth.We expect the following factors to contribute to potential demand for our communications infrastructure:•consumers' growing wireless data consumption leading major wireless carriers to upgrade and enhance their networks through the efficient use of both towers and small cells, including in connection with 5G deployments, in an effort to improve network quality and capacity and customer retention or satisfaction;•prior and future potential spectrum auctioned, licensed or made available by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") enabling additional wireless carrier network development; •next-generation technologies and new uses for wireless communications may potentially result in new entrants or increased demand in the wireless industry, which may include companies involved in the continued evolution and deployment of the Internet of Things; •the continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive applications could result in demand for high-capacity, multi-location, fiber-based network solutions; and•increased government initiatives to expand broadband infrastructure to support connectivity throughout the U.S.The CompanyVirtually all of our operations in both our Towers and Fiber operating segments are located in the U.S. For more information about our operating segments, see \"Item 7. MD&A—Results of Operations\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Our core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to our shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in the U.S. We believe our communications infrastructure is integral to our tenants' networks and organizations. See \"Item 1. Business—Strategy.\"Towers Segment. We believe towers are the most efficient and cost-effective solution for providing coverage and capacity for wireless carrier network deployments. We acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers directly or indirectly from the largest U.S. wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999, including towers from (1) AT&T in 2013, (2) T-Mobile in 2012, (3) companies now part of T-Mobile in 2007, (4) companies now part of Verizon Wireless in 1999 and 2000 and (5) companies now part of AT&T in 1999 and 2000.We generally receive monthly rental payments and, in some cases, upfront payments, from our Towers tenants pursuant to long-term tenant contracts with (1) initial contract terms of five to 15 years, (2) multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each, exercisable at the option of the tenant, (3) limited termination rights for our tenants and (4) contractual escalations of the rental price. We strive to negotiate with our existing tenant base for longer contractual terms, which often contain fixed escalation rates.Our Towers tenant contracts, while amended and re-negotiated over time, have historically led to a long-term relationship with tenants on our towers, resulting in a retention rate generally between 98% and 99% each year. In general, each renewable tenant contract automatically renews at the end of its term unless (1) the tenant provides prior notice of its intent not to renew or (2) the contract is amended or re-negotiated. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding expected higher non-renewals (which we define as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates) as a result of the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. See note 3 to our 6consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the minimum rental payments due to us by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts without consideration of tenant renewal options as of December 31, 2022.The average monthly rental payment from a new tenant added to towers can vary based on (1) aggregate tenant volume, (2) the location of the tower, or (3) the amount of tower and ground space leased to a tenant, which can be influenced by the quantity, size, and weight of the tenant's antenna installation or related equipment. When possible, we seek to receive rental payment increases in connection with tenant contract amendments, pursuant to which our tenants add antennas or other equipment to our towers or ground space on which they already have equipment pursuant to preexisting tenant contracts. Our Towers tenant contracts and pricing are not influenced by whether or not we perform the respective site development or installation services. See \"—Services\" below for a further discussion of our tower installation services. As of December 31, 2022, the average number of tenants (calculated as a unique license together with any related amendments thereto) per tower was approximately 2.4.Fiber Segment. Our Fiber segment consists of small cells and fiber solutions. •Our small cells offload data traffic from towers and bolster our tenants' network capacity where data demand is the greatest and are typically attached to public right-of-way infrastructure, including utility poles and street lights.•We offer fiber solutions to large wireless carriers and organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands. Our fiber solutions provide essential connectivity resources needed to create integrated networks and support organizations. Most of our fiber assets were acquired through transactions dating back to 2012, with the largest transactions occurring in 2017. Our fiber assets include those we acquired from: (1) NextG Networks, Inc. in 2012, (2) Quanta Fiber Networks, Inc. in 2015, (3) FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC and certain other subsidiaries of NextEra Energy, Inc. in 2017, (4) Wilcon Holdings LLC in 2017 and (5) LTS Group Holdings LLC in 2017.We generally receive monthly recurring payments and, in some cases, upfront payments, from our Fiber tenants pursuant to tenant contracts with initial terms that generally vary between three to 20 years. The average monthly rental payment from a new tenant can vary based on the amount or cost of (1) construction for initial and subsequent tenants, (2) fiber strand requirements and supply, (3) equipment at the site, (4) the market in the U.S. where the fiber is located and (5) any upfront payment received.Additional Site Rental Information. For both our Towers and Fiber segments, we have existing master agreements with our largest tenants, including T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Such agreements provide certain terms (including economic terms) that govern underlying contracts (entered into during the term of the master agreements) regarding the right to use our communications infrastructure by such tenants.Approximately half of our site rental costs of operations consists of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses (primarily leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate our communications infrastructure), property taxes, repairs and maintenance, employee compensation or related benefit costs, and utilities. Assuming current leasing activity levels, our cash operating expenses generally tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation. We seek to add tenants to our existing communications infrastructure at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns to our business. Once constructed, our communications infrastructure requires minimal sustaining capital expenditures, including maintenance or other non-discretionary capital expenditures, which are typically between 1% and 2% of net revenues. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the rental payments we owe to landlords pursuant to our operating lease agreements.Services. As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. In 2022, approximately 45% of our services and other revenues related to installation services, and the remainder predominately related to site development services. We seek to grow our services revenues by capitalizing on (1) increased leasing volumes that may result from carrier network upgrades, (2) promoting site development services, (3) expanding the scope of our services, and (4) focusing on tenant service and deployment speed. We have the capability and expertise to install, with the assistance of our network of subcontractors, equipment or antenna systems for our tenants. We do not always provide the installation services or site development services for our tenants on our communications infrastructure as other service providers also provide these services (see also \"—Competition\" below). These services are typically non-recurring and highly competitive, with several competitors in most markets. Typically, our site development services and installation services are billed on a fixed fee basis, and the terms and pricing of both site development services and installation services are negotiated separately from our tenant contracts.7Customers. Our Towers customers are primarily comprised of large wireless carriers that operate national networks.Our Fiber customers generally consist of large wireless carriers and organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands, such as enterprise (including healthcare and financial), wholesale, government and education institutions.Our three largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Collectively, these three tenants accounted for approximately three-fourths of our 2022 site rental revenues. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for risks associated with our dependence on a small number of customers and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. For 2022, our site rental revenues by tenant were as follows:Sales and Marketing. Our sales organization markets our communications infrastructure with the objective of contracting access with tenants to existing communications infrastructure or to new communications infrastructure prior to construction. We seek to become the critical partner and preferred independent communications infrastructure provider for our tenants and increase tenant satisfaction relative to our peers by leveraging our (1) existing unique communications infrastructure footprint, (2) tenant relationships, (3) process-centric approach, (4) technological tools and (5) construction capabilities and expertise.Our sales team is organized based on a variety of factors, including tenant type (such as large wireless carriers, vertical customers and organizations), product offering and geography. A team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest tenants. These directors work to develop new business opportunities, as well as to ensure that tenants' communications infrastructure needs are efficiently translated into new contracts for our communications infrastructure. Sales personnel in our local offices develop and maintain relationships with our tenants that are expanding their networks, entering new markets, seeking new or additional communication infrastructure offerings, bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add-on business. In addition to our full-time sales or marketing staff, a number of senior-level employees spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing or prospective tenants.Competition. We face competition for site rental tenants from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including competitors that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors, such as cable providers) or small cells, (2) tenants who elect to self-perform or (3) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.Some of our largest competitors in the Towers segment are American Tower Corporation and SBA Communications Corporation. Our Fiber segment business competitors can vary significantly based on geography. Some of the larger competitors in the Fiber segment include other owners of fiber, tenants who elect to self-perform and recent and potential entrants into small cells and the fiber solutions business. We believe that location, existing communications infrastructure footprint, deployment speed, quality of service, expertise, reputation, capacity and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting our businesses. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of competition in our industry.Competitors to our services offering can include site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners or managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, our tenants' internal staff or contractors, or telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors. We believe that our tenants base their decisions on the outsourcing of services on criteria such as a company's experience, record of accomplishment, reputation, price and time for completion of a project.8Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")Our shared communications infrastructure model results in the use of fewer resources, including water, energy, metals and other materials, than would otherwise be needed to construct and maintain communications infrastructure. We are committed to operating responsibly and ethically and considering social and environmental impacts as we make business decisions. We maintain annual sustainability targets in our senior unsecured credit facility. Further, we have a goal to be carbon neutral by 2025 in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by continuing to invest in energy reduction initiatives, sourcing renewable energy, and, to a lesser extent, utilizing carbon credits or offsets. We plan to continue investing in projects that are both good for our business and good for the environment.The Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee assists the board of directors with ESG oversight. Our executive management team and senior management keep our board of directors apprised of our ESG priorities, goals and initiatives. Together, our board of directors and executive management team define our strategic approach to managing actual and potential impacts of significant ESG risks and opportunities.Additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and progress is also available through the Investors section of our website at https://investor.crowncastle.com. The information on our website, including our ESG Reports, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference into this 2022 Form 10-K or any other filings with the SEC unless expressly noted in any such other filings.Human CapitalThe people who work for Crown Castle are essential to our ability to execute on our strategy. As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 5,000 people, all of whom were based in the U.S. From time to time, we also add contingent workers to support our business.We believe attracting, developing and retaining talented employees is paramount to serving our customers and our communities and creating value for our stockholders. Our core values shape our culture, drive our decision-making and guide our interactions with one another and our customers. Our 2022 annual employee survey indicated strong employee engagement exceeding U.S. company norms.We continue to focus on building and retaining a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive community to make our company stronger and more innovative. We actively partner with non-profit and community organizations to create a diverse talent pipeline. In addition, our board of directors is currently comprised of 60% female or racially diverse directors, including each of the four most recently appointed directors.The well-being of our employees is a crucial element of our safety culture, employee engagement and productivity. We offer a competitive total rewards package which includes market-based pay, performance-based annual incentive awards, healthcare and retirement benefits, mental health benefits, parental and family leave, holiday and paid time off and tuition assistance. We further invest in our employees' professional growth and development by providing resources and opportunities to hone their skills and expand their subject-matter expertise, which empowers them to advance their careers and enables our business to prosper. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages.Regulatory and Environmental MattersWe are required to comply with a variety of federal, state and local regulations and laws in the U.S., including FCC and Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") regulations and those discussed under \"—Environmental\" below. To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations, including any environmental regulations. The summary below is based on regulations currently in effect, and such regulations are subject to review or modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be fined or lose our rights to conduct some of our business.Federal Regulations. Both the FCC and the FAA regulate towers used for wireless communications, radio, or television broadcasting. Such regulations control the siting, construction, modification, lighting, and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require the registration of tower facilities with the FCC and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used. In addition, the FCC and the FAA have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower or antenna structures based upon the height or location, including proximity to airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing tower or antenna structures above certain heights 9are reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation, which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting or marking requirements. The FCC requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with FAA rules and are registered with the FCC, if required by its regulations. Where tower lighting is required by FAA regulation, tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage and ensuring the timely restoration of such outages.State and Local Regulations. The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities' jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers and small cells. The law, however, limits state and local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by such authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless communications or prohibit altogether (actually or effectively) the provision of wireless communications. Additionally, the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations.Local regulations include city and other local ordinances (including subdivision and zoning ordinances), approvals for construction, modification and removal of towers and small cells, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require us to obtain prior approval from local officials. Local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or small cells, or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents' concerns regarding the height, visibility, or other characteristics of such infrastructure. Over the last several years, the FCC has adopted regulations and 30 states have passed legislation intended to expedite and streamline the deployment of wireless networks, including establishing presumptively reasonable timeframes for reviews by local and state governments. Notwithstanding such developments, decisions of local regulatory authorities and utilities in certain jurisdictions may continue to adversely affect deployment timing and cost. Certain of our subsidiaries hold state authorizations, including authorizations to act as competitive local exchange carriers (\"CLECs\"), to provide intrastate telecommunication services in addition to FCC authorization to provide domestic interstate telecommunication services. State authorizations may help promote access to public rights-of-way, which is beneficial to the timely deployment of fiber and small cells, and often allow us to deploy such infrastructure in locations where zoning restrictions might otherwise delay, restrict, or prevent building or expanding traditional wireless tower and rooftop sites. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding rights to our infrastructure.Environmental. We are required to comply with a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations protecting environmental quality, including air and water quality, and wildlife. To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for additional information regarding compliance with laws and regulations.The construction of new towers and small cells or, in some cases, their modification in the U.S. may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (\"NEPA\"), which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions. NEPA regulations require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower or small cells construction. If the FCC determines that the proposed tower or small cells construction or modification presents a significant environmental impact, the FCC is required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which is subject to public comment. Such determination could significantly delay the FCC's approval of the construction or modification.Our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission, or remediation of, or exposure to, hazardous or non-hazardous substances, materials, or wastes. As an owner, lessee, or operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint-and-several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination relating to existing or historical operations; or we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination. In general, our tenant contracts prohibit our tenants from using or storing any hazardous substances on our communications infrastructure sites in violation of applicable environmental laws and require our tenants to provide notice of certain environmental conditions caused by them.We are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure. In recent years, the scientific community has extensively studied low-level radio frequency emissions to determine whether they have any connection to certain negative health effects, such as cancer.We have compliance programs and monitoring projects designed to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us.10Available InformationWe maintain a website at www.crowncastle.com.

Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).Tenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on consumers' and organizations' demand for data. Additionally, the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure, or renew or extend existing tenant contracts on our communications infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:•availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests;•location of our communications infrastructure;•financial condition of our tenants, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital, including through government funding;•willingness of our tenants to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;•need for integrated networks and organizations;•availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;•increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our tenants;•mergers or consolidations by and among our tenants;•changes in, or success of, our tenants' business models;•governmental regulations and initiatives, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure;•cost of constructing communications infrastructure;•our market competition, including tenants that may elect to self-perform;•technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; and•our ability to efficiently satisfy our tenants' service requirements.A slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. If our current or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services. The amount, timing, and mix of our tenants' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. Changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure. As a result, changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new and emerging technologies (including small cells and fiber solutions), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Furthermore, the industries in which our tenants operate (particularly those in the wireless industry) could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for data or general economic conditions. There can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services. In addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services. Such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.12A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues, reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services and impact our dividend per share growth.Our three largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. The loss of any one of our largest tenants as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, communications infrastructure assets, or intangible assets (including goodwill), or (4) other adverse effects to our business. We cannot guarantee that tenant contracts with our largest tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their tenant contracts with us. In addition to our three largest tenants, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from (1) fiber solutions tenants and (2) new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services. Such tenants (including those dependent on government funding) may be smaller or have less financial resources than our three largest tenants, may have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital. Consolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example, where they are co-residents on a tower or small cell network, which may result in the termination, non-renewal or re-negotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant contracts, we generally expect that the impact to our site rental revenues from any termination of our tenant contracts as a result of such potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. Such consolidation (or potential consolidation) may result in a reduction or slowdown in such tenants' network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. Tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure and services, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain long-lived assets.On January 6, 2022, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile that contemplates T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation. We anticipate that this consolidation will result in higher Towers non-renewals in 2025, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $200 million. Except for full year 2025, we expect our annual Towers non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues. Additionally, we anticipate that the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation will result in small cell non-renewals, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $45 million, with approximately half occurring in 2023 and the remainder occurring in 2024 and 2025. Excluding the anticipated impact from the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation, we expect consolidated annual small cell non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues.Due to network consolidation non-renewals and interest rate increases discussed in \"—Risks Related to Our Debt and Equity,\" we expect our annual dividend per share growth through 2025 to be below our long-term annual target.See \"Item 1. Business—The Company\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants. The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. We seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings, or other strategic growth opportunities. In the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. Such transactions or activities could be complex, costly and time-consuming, or cause disruptions in, increase risk to or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things, such transactions and activities may: •disrupt our business relationships with our tenants, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;•divert capital and the time or attention of management away from other business operations, including as a result of post-transaction integration activities;•fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated; •increase operational risk or volatility in our business; •not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected;•impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees; •increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees; or13•result in the need for additional TRSs or contributions of certain assets to TRSs, which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Over the last decade, we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our Fiber business, which is a much less mature business for us than our Towers business. Our Fiber segment represented 31% and 33% of our site rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The business model for our Fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our Towers operations, including those relating to tenant base, competition, contract terms (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), upfront capital requirements, landlord demographics, deployment and ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements, government regulations, growth rates and applicable laws.While our Fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our Towers operations, they also have certain operational risks (including the scalability of processes) that are different from our Towers business, including:•the use of public rights-of-way and franchise agreements; •the use of poles and conduits owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties; •risks relating to overbuilding competitive fiber assets; •risks relating to the specific markets in which we choose or plan to operate;•risks relating to construction hazards, including boring, trenching, utility and maintenance of traffic hazards;•construction management and construction-related billings to tenants;•risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks, or tenants utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets;•the risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands;•damage to our assets and the need to maintain, repair, upgrade and periodically replace our assets;•the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software;•network data security risks; •the risk of new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber; •potential damage to our overall reputation as a communications infrastructure provider; and•the use of CLEC status.In addition, the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether. For example, our tenants have initially focused on utilizing towers in the first phase of deploying their 5G networks, which has led to delays in some of our small cell deployments. We anticipate that these delays will be temporary, as our tenants plan for the next phase of their 5G network deployment which we believe will require small cells at scale. Our Fiber operations also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our Towers business as a result of numerous factors, including those stemming from the deployment, location or nature of the assets involved. There may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve, and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.Our construction projects and related contracts can be long-term, complex in nature, dangerous, costly and challenging to execute. The quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage (1) the associated tenant relationship and (2) the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources. In connection with our construction projects, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, labor availability and productivity, and contractor pricing and performance.In addition, the construction projects (including modifications of existing communications infrastructure) can pose certain safety risks, including:•risks resulting from elevated work, including falling hazards;•risks of third-party non-compliance with safety regulations, industry best practices or other applicable standards;•risks associated with utility hazards, including gas line, electrical or sewage strikes, which may result in explosions, electrocution and other potentially catastrophic events; and•risk of potential wildfires, including due to welding, grinding, cutting, or other construction activity.14Such safety risks may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, suspension of operations or services, or significant damage to the environment, creating financial, regulatory or reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. See \"Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events\" below for additional information regarding potential adverse impacts to our business which may result from wildfires and other climate-related events.Further, investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels. Additionally, contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. We often experience unforeseen delays from municipalities and utility companies that result in longer construction timelines than expected, which impact our ability to timely deliver on our projects. We may also experience unforeseen delays and increased project costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which may impact the availability of equipment and materials needed for, and availability of contractors to work on, our construction projects. Our failure to manage such tenant relationships, project resources, and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner and appropriately manage safety risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.Improvements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure. For example, new technologies and spectrum that may promote network sharing, joint development, backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants, such as signal combining technologies or network virtualization, may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure. In addition, other technologies, such as WiFi, blimps, satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed. In addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.The property interests and other rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land under our towers, are derived from leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and franchise and other agreements. A loss of these interests and other rights may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms.Our ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers are located depends on our ability to purchase such land, by acquiring fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the agreements relating to such land. Approximately 10% of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years. If we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located, our business may be adversely affected.As of December 31, 2022, approximately 53% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. Even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the T-Mobile or AT&T towers for business or other reasons. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. Additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of December 31, 2022 is as follows:•22% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master lease or other related agreements with AT&T for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the 15respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.•31% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases or other agreements with T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). Approximately half of such towers have an initial term of 32 years (through May 2037), and we have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of such leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile for approximately $2.3 billion. The remainder of such towers have a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase such towers from T-Mobile at the end of the respective terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. In addition, another 1% of our towers under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with T-Mobile are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with AT&T. We have the option to purchase these towers from AT&T at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due prior to 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).Under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to operate and manage, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. If one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. If our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.For our small cells and fiber, we must maintain rights-of-way, franchise, pole attachment, conduit use, fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct, maintain and operate our fiber assets. Access to rights-of-way may depend on our CLEC status, and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will (1) recognize such CLEC status or (2) not change their laws concerning CLEC access to rights-of-way. If a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed, we might be forced to abandon our assets, which may adversely impact our business. In order to operate our assets, we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms, we may face increased costs or reduced revenues.Additionally, in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations, we often need to obtain new or additional rights-of-way and other agreements. Our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and cost-effective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint, which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.The operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its non-recurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. Our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•competition;•the timing, mix and amount of tenant network investments;•the rate and volume of tenant deployment plans;•unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;•economic weakness or uncertainty;•labor availability and productivity;•our market share; and•changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.16If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies (such as 5G) may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new wireless technologies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services and technologies. If a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.Despite existing security measures, certain of our information technology and communications infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious software, cyber-attacks and other security breaches. In addition, our increased reliance on cloud- or internet-based services and on remote access to information systems to accommodate our hybrid work environment increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity incidents. An attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants or access by our tenants to certain of our information technology systems, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants, (3) data transmitted over our tenants' networks being compromised or misappropriated, or (4) business or other sensitive data being compromised, misappropriated or lost. Although we believe we have a comprehensive incident response plan and other cybersecurity measures and policies in place, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. Additionally, security incidents impacting our tenants, vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. If an actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity or information technology, or that of our cloud- or internet-based service providers, occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose tenants. Further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. In addition, our acquisitions, both past and future, may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above. While we maintain insurance that includes coverage in the event of cybersecurity or other information technology breaches, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such incidents.Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.We could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events, such as extreme weather events or natural disasters (including as a result of any potential effects of climate change), or acts of vandalism. There is increasing concern that global climate change is occurring and could result in increased frequency of certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Although we have implemented a wildfire risk mitigation program, the effects of climate change have increased the risk and extent of wildfires that could potentially result from certain of our construction and maintenance projects and other operating activities. We cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our business. Any such unforeseen events could, among other things, damage or delay deployment of our communications infrastructure, interrupt or delay service to our tenants or could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.While we currently maintain insurance policies that include coverage in the event of natural disasters and other unforeseen events, including possible incidents in which our actions (or the actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to such events, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such events. Further, we do not maintain, and do not expect to maintain, insurance policies that provide adequate coverage in the event that our actions (or those actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to a wildfire event, as a result of the fact that such insurance policies are generally not economically available.17As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.Our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts (including amendments to tenant contracts upon modification of existing towers, small cells or fiber), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate. Competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. In addition, competition (primarily in our fiber solutions business) may, in certain circumstances, cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations. We face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including those that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors such as cable providers) or small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.Our Fiber business generally has different competitors than those in our Towers business, including other owners of fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions, some of which may have larger networks, greater financial resources or more experience in managing such assets than we have.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.There can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies, which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure, will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. In addition, demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.Our focus on and disclosure of our ESG position, metrics, strategy, goals and initiatives expose us to potential litigation and other adverse effects to our business.In recent years, our investors, tenants, employees and other stakeholders have increased their focus on ESG matters and disclosure. In response, we have published ESG reports and related materials and made other public announcements regarding our ESG position, initiatives and goals. Our ESG metrics, initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards that are still developing and that may not be uniformly adopted or applied by other companies, processes and internal controls that continue to evolve, potentially missing or deficient third-party data, wide range of acceptable estimation techniques, and estimates and assumptions that are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty and may change more frequently than those underlying our financial metrics. Our ESG initiatives and goals may be difficult to implement and may increase operating costs and result in changes to certain of our operations, assets and processes. In addition, a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations are developing climate change-based laws and regulations, with varying scopes and complexity, that could, if adopted, significantly increase compliance burdens and associated costs.Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, accurately report our metrics or adhere to public statements exposes us to potential litigation, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.We operate in a challenging labor market and failure to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees could adversely affect our business, operations and costs. Our ability to sustain and grow our business and execute on our strategy requires us, in part, to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees, including key management personnel and other talent. We have experienced an extremely competitive labor market that continues to tighten due to macroeconomic conditions and elevated levels of turnover stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. To remain competitive, some employers are offering increased compensation and benefits and opportunities to work with greater flexibility, including remote work on a permanent basis. We currently operate under a hybrid work model, meaning that the majority of our employees have the flexibility to work remotely for a portion of the workweek. As the competition for talent remains intense, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs to attract, recruit and retain necessary talent, including increased compensation, benefits or other employee-related costs. Our failure to successfully attract, recruit and retain key employees could adversely impact our business, operations, and costs.18Risks Related to Our Debt and EquityOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $21.7 billion as of February 21, 2023). See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. As a result of our substantial indebtedness:•we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;•we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;•we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\";•we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;•we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;•we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates (see below);•we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments;•we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet our debt payment obligations;•we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; and•we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT due to limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.Over the past 11 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate eight times for a cumulative increase of 4.50% and has signaled further increases in the near-term, which could further increase interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of February 21, 2023, approximately 12% of our outstanding indebtedness consisted of variable interest rates, with a weighted average rate of 5.6%. Any significant increase in the amount of our variable rate debt or interest rate on such debt could adversely impact our borrowing cost, financial results and our ability to meet our dividend growth targets, strategically deploy our capital or execute our business plan. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our interest rate risk.Currently we have debt instruments in place that limit, in certain circumstances, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. In addition, the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility (\"2016 Credit Agreement\"), which consists of our senior unsecured term loan A facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively, \"2016 Credit Facility\"), contains financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. Furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. If our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.CCI is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, CCI's sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. Earnings and cash flows generated by CCI's subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to CCI, in the absence of any special conditions, such as a continuing event of default. However, CCI's subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.19We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which, upon final maturity, we will need to refinance or repay. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all. As of February 21, 2023, approximately 51% of our fixed rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%, is scheduled to mature over the next five years. If interest rates remain elevated or continue to increase, we may have to (1) refinance our maturing fixed rate debt at interest rates that exceed the current interest rates on such debt or (2) use our variable interest rate debt to repay such fixed rate debt, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.Economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact (1) the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above, (2) our ability to draw the full amount of our $7.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Facility (\"2016 Revolver\"), that, as of February 21, 2023, had $6.7 billion of undrawn availability, or (3) our ability to issue the full amount of the $2.0 billion commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\") under our unsecured commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), that, as of February 21, 2023, had $1.2 billion outstanding.If we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. In such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet our debt payment obligations. Failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. Our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. We maintain an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program (\"2021 ATM Program\") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million to or through sales agents. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2021 ATM Program. From time to time, we may refresh or implement a new \"at-the-market\" stock offering program. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately 433 million shares of common stock outstanding.We have reserved an aggregate of approximately 16 million of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our stock compensation plans.Further, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, (\"Charter\"), amended and restated by-laws (\"By-laws\") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti-takeover provisions include:•the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; •advance notice and other procedural requirements relating to director nominations or proposals submitted by stockholders for actions to be taken at annual meetings of stockholders; and•provisions that the state courts or, in certain circumstances, the federal courts, in Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us, our directors, officers, employees and stockholders, and, unless the 20Company otherwise consents, that the federal courts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). Since the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought pursuant to the Securities Act, there may be uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. Stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws, and this provision does not apply to claims for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction (such as under the Exchange Act).Our By-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our Chief Executive Officer or the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.In addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.Risks Relating to Corporate ComplianceIf we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.A variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in \"Item 1. Business.\" Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties, require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws, will not adversely affect our business (including our REIT status), increase delays or result in additional costs. We also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations, such as those governing environmental and safety matters. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us.Risks Relating to Our REIT StatusFuture dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.During each of the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, totaling approximately $1.9 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.565 per share, which represents an increase of 6.5% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2022. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. Any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs) to our stockholders. Our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See also \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend.\" As discussed in \"Item 1. Business—Strategy,\" we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. Our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): construction of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. External financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. As a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.21Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, thereby increasing our tax obligations and reducing our available cash.As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders.While we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the importance of ongoing factual determinations, the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting REITs, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year. In addition, the present U.S. federal tax treatment of REITs is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and any such change might adversely affect our REIT status or benefits. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that such changes, if enacted, might have on our business. However, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business, including our REIT status. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, then:•we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income;•we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and, for years beginning before January 1, 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax; and•we would be disqualified from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified.Although we may have federal NOLs available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal NOLs have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.Under the Code, for taxable years beginning in or after 2018, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. These limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a REIT.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are required to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement as described above. We commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal NOLs of approximately $1.5 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.From time to time, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would 22otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Furthermore, the REIT dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.In addition to satisfying the 90% distribution requirement, to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. Compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent, limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. In addition, our status as a REIT may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.Moreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock. In order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer \"individuals\" (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year. In order to facilitate compliance with the REIT rules, our Charter includes provisions regarding REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any \"person\" (as defined in our Charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than (1) 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or (2) 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock. In addition, our Charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. These ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders. CertificationsWe submitted the Chief Executive Officer certification required by Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") Listed Company Manual, relating to compliance with the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards, to the NYSE on May 26, 2022 with no qualifications. We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this 2022 Form 10-K.23Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.     PropertiesCommunications Infrastructure We own, lease or manage more than 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. Towers are vertical metal structures generally ranging in height from 50 to 300 feet. Our tenants' wireless equipment may be placed on towers, building rooftops and other structures. Our towers are located on tracts of land that support the towers, equipment shelters and, where applicable, guy-wires to stabilize the tower.Additionally, we own or lease approximately 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting our (1) approximately 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (2) fiber solutions. The majority of our fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas. Our small cells and fiber are typically located outdoors and are often attached to public right-of-way infrastructure, including utility poles or street lights. See the following for further information regarding our communications infrastructure:•\"Item 1. Business—Overview\" for information regarding our tower and fiber portfolios.•\"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Material Cash Requirements\" for information regarding our lease obligations.•\"Schedule III - Schedule of Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\" for further information on our productive properties.Approximately 53% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a further discussion. Substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications. Additionally, if so inclined as a result of a request for a tenant addition, we could generally replace an existing tower with another tower, replace a small cell network antenna with another antenna or overlay additional fiber in order to provide additional coverage or capacity, subject to certain restrictions.OfficesOur principal corporate headquarters is owned and located in Houston, Texas. In addition, we have offices throughout the U.S. in locations convenient for the management and operation of our communications infrastructure, with significant consideration being given to the amount of our communications infrastructure located in a particular area. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs.Item 3.     Legal ProceedingsWe are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Most of these proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business involve disputes with landlords, vendors, collection matters involving bankrupt tenants, zoning or siting matters, construction, condemnation, tax, employment, or wrongful termination matters. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us.See the disclosure in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.Item 4.     Mine Safety DisclosuresN/A24PART IIItem 5.     Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and HoldersOur common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"CCI.\" As of February 21, 2023, there were approximately 542 holders of record of our common stock.Dividend PolicyWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income after the utilization of any available NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).

MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities—Common Stock\" and notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements.Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our growth in cash flows. The declaration amount and payment of any future dividends, however, are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on then-current or anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing NOLs, or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited under certain circumstances by the terms of our debt instruments.25Performance GraphThe following performance graph is a comparison of the five-year cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock against the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Market Index and the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index for the period commencing December 31, 2017 and ending December 31, 2022.

See \"Item 1. Business\" for a further discussion of our business, including our long-term strategy, our REIT status, certain key terms of our tenant contracts and growth trends in the demand for data. Site rental revenues represented 90% of our 2022 consolidated net revenues. The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in prior years.Highlights of Business Fundamentals and Results•We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes (see \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" and notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements)•Potential growth resulting from the increasing demand for data ◦We expect existing and potential new tenant demand for our communications infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of mobile entertainment, mobile internet, and machine-to-machine applications, (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including the use of both towers and small cells, (6) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications), (7) the availability of additional spectrum and (8) increased government initiatives to support connectivity throughout the U.S.◦We expect U.S. wireless carriers will continue to focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity (including through 5G initiatives) by utilizing a combination of towers and small cells. We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless tenants' growing communications infrastructure needs. ◦We expect organizations will continue to increase the usage of high-bandwidth applications that will require the utilization of more fiber infrastructure and fiber solutions, such as those we provide. ◦Within our Fiber segment, we are able to generate growth and returns for our stockholders by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions tenants. ◦Tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure are achieved at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns. ◦Substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications.•Returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also \"Item 1. Business—Strategy\")◦During 2022, we paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $2.6 billion. See \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend\" for a discussion of the increase to our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2022.•Investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share ◦We had discretionary capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, predominately resulting from the construction of new communications infrastructure and improvements to existing communications infrastructure in order to support additional tenants. ◦We expect to continue to construct and acquire new communications infrastructure based on our tenants' needs and generate attractive long-term returns by adding additional tenants over time. •Site rental revenues under long-term tenant contracts◦Our wireless tenant contracts have initial terms of five to 15 years with contractual escalators and multiple renewal periods of five to 10 years each, exercisable at the option of the tenant. ◦Our fiber solutions tenant contracts' initial terms generally vary between three to 20 years (including tenant contracts with organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands). ◦As of December 31, 2022, our weighted-average remaining term was approximately six years, exclusive of renewals exercisable at the tenants' option, currently representing approximately $40 billion of expected future cash inflows.•Majority of our revenues from large wireless carriers 27◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately three-fourths of our site rental revenues were derived from T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our largest customers.•Majority of land under our towers under long-term control ◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our towers site rental gross margin and approximately 80% of our towers site rental gross margin was derived from towers located on land that we own or control for greater than 10 and 20 years, respectively. The aforementioned percentages include towers located on land that is owned, including through fee interests and perpetual easements, which represented approximately 40% of our towers site rental gross margin.•Majority of our fiber assets are located in major metropolitan areas and are on public rights-of-way •Minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements ◦For the year ended December 31, 2022, sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately 1% of net revenues. •Debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the vast majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our debt)◦As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due January 2028 (\"January 2023 Senior Notes\") and the use of proceeds therefrom, our outstanding debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and weighted average maturity of approximately eight years (assuming anticipated repayment dates where applicable).◦As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, 87% of our debt has fixed rate coupons.◦Our debt service coverage and leverage ratios are within their respective financial maintenance covenants. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.•During 2022, we refinanced and extended the maturities of certain of our debt (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities\" for further discussion of our debt transactions)•Significant cash flows from operations ◦Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022,◦In addition to the positive impact of contractual escalators, we expect to grow our core business of providing access to our communications infrastructure as a result of future anticipated additional demand for our communications infrastructure. Common Stock DividendIn the aggregate, we paid approximately $2.6 billion in common stock dividends during 2022. During each of the first three quarters of 2022, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, totaling approximately $1.9 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $1.565 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 6.5% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2022. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our growth in cash flows. Any future common stock dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.Outlook HighlightsThe following are certain highlights of our outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above.•We expect that, when compared to full year 2022, our full year 2023 site rental revenues growth will be positively impacted by tenant additions as large wireless carriers and fiber solutions tenants continue to focus on meeting the increasing demand for data.•We expect to continue to invest a significant amount of our available capital in the form of discretionary capital expenditures for 2023 based on the anticipated returns on such discretionary investments.◦We expect that our discretionary capital expenditures will increase as we accelerate the pace of small cell deployments.•We also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2% of net revenues for full year 2023, consistent with historical annual levels.28Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021 should be read in conjunction with \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and our consolidated financial statements.

MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Non-GAAP and Segment Financial Measures.\"292022 and 2021 Total site rental revenues for 2022 grew by $570 million, or 10%, from 2021. This increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below: (In millions of dollars) (a)Represents site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of the impacts from both straight-line accounting and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP.(b)Represents the contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions.(c)Prepaid rent amortization includes amortization of upfront payments received from long-term tenants and other deferred credits.Towers site rental revenues for 2022 were $4.3 billion and increased by $518 million, or 14%, from $3.8 billion during 2021. The increase in Towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, escalators and non-renewals of tenant contracts. Tenant additions were influenced by our tenants' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.Fiber site rental revenues for 2022 were $2.0 billion and increased by $52 million, or 3%, from $1.9 billion during 2021. The increase in Fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions. Increased demand for small cells was driven by our tenants' network strategy in an effort to provide capacity and relieve network congestion, and increased demand for fiber solutions was driven by increasing demand for data.The increase in Towers site rental gross margin from 2021 to 2022 was related to the previously-mentioned 14% increase in Towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. The increase in Fiber site rental gross margin was predominately related to the previously-mentioned 3% increase in Fiber site rental revenues.Towers services and other gross margin for 2022 was $238 million and increased by $51 million, or 27%, from $187 million during 2021, which is a reflection of the increased volume of activity from carriers' network enhancements and the volume and mix of services and other work. Revenues from our services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term tenant contracts.Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2022 were $750 million and increased by $70 million, or 10%, from $680 million during 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our business and certain costs, including travel and facilities, returning to their pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels following our return to office in February 2022.30Towers operating profit for 2022 increased by $532 million, or 18%, from 2021. The increase in Towers operating profit was primarily related to the previously-mentioned increases in Towers site rental gross margin and Towers services and other gross margin.Fiber operating profit for 2022 increased by $19 million, or 2%, from 2021. The increase in Fiber operating profit was primarily related to the previously-mentioned increase in Fiber site rental gross margin.Depreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.7 billion for 2022 and increased by $63 million, or 4%, from 2021. This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were $699 million for 2022 and increased by $42 million, or 6%, from $657 million during 2021. The increase predominately resulted from an increase in the interest rates on the 2016 Term Loan A, 2016 Revolver and outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, as well as an increase in our outstanding indebtedness due to the financing of our discretionary capital expenditures. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a further discussion of our debt and interest rate increases.As a result of repaying certain of our indebtedness in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses on retirement of long-term obligations of $28 million and $145 million for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.The provisions for income taxes for 2022 and 2021 were $16 million and $21 million, respectively. For both 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Income from continuing operations was $1.7 billion during 2022 compared to $1.2 billion during 2021. The increase was related to (1) growth in our site rental activities in both our Towers and Fiber segments, (2) the previously-mentioned increase in Towers services activity and (3) the decrease in losses of retirement of long-term obligations, partially offset by an increase in expenses, including (1) selling, general and administrative expenses, (2) depreciation, amortization and accretion and (3) interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs.Net income attributable to CCI stockholders increased by $579 million, or 53%, from 2021 to 2022. The increase was due to the previously-mentioned increase in income from continuing operations.Adjusted EBITDA increased by $524 million, or 14%, from 2021 to 2022. The increase was predominately related to the growth in our site rental activities in both our Towers and Fiber segments as well as the previously-mentioned increase in Towers service activity.31Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewGeneral. Our core business generates revenues under long-term tenant contracts (see \"Item 1. Business—Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Overview\") from (1) the largest U.S. wireless carriers and (2) fiber solutions tenants. As a leading provider of shared communications infrastructure in the U.S., our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash generated by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends, and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. Our strategy is based, in part, on our belief that the U.S. is the most attractive market for shared communications infrastructure investment with the greatest long-term growth potential. We measure our efforts to create \"long-term stockholder value\" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. See \"Item 1. Business—Strategy\" for a further discussion of our strategy. We have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. Our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): constructing communications infrastructure, acquiring communications infrastructure, acquiring land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers), improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure, purchasing shares of our common stock, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. We have recently spent, and expect to continue to spend, a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of small cells and fiber. We seek to fund our discretionary investments with both cash generated by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our availability under our 2016 Revolver, issuances under our CP Program, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity-related securities, including under our 2021 ATM Program. We seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital. We target a leverage ratio of approximately five times Adjusted EBITDA, subject to various factors, such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments. We may choose to increase or decrease our leverage from this target for various periods of time. Our contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of (1) Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, (2) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.150% senior unsecured notes (\"3.150% Senior Notes\") and (3) principal payments on certain outstanding debt.We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our REIT status and our NOLs. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Liquidity Position. The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt as well as note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our 2021 ATM Program.(In millions of dollars)Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(a)$327 Undrawn 2016 Revolver availability(b)6,649 Total debt and other obligations (current and non-current)21,729 Total equity7,449   (a)Inclusive of $5 million included within \"Other assets, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet.(b)Availability at any point in time is subject to certain restrictions based on the maintenance of financial covenants contained in our 2016 Credit Facility. At any point in time, we intend to maintain available commitments under our 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of outstanding Commercial Paper Notes. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.Over the next 12 months: •Our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) cash generated by our operating activities, (3) availability under our 2016 Revolver, (4) issuances under our CP Program, and (5) issuances of equity pursuant to our 2021 ATM Program. Our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt obligations of $2.1 billion (consisting of Commercial Paper Notes, the 3.150% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt), (2) cumulative common stock dividend payments expected to be at least $6.26 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion (see \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend\"), and (3) capital expenditures. We may also purchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, amounts available under our CP 32Program may be repaid and re-issued from time to time. During the next 12 months, while our liquidity uses are expected to exceed our cash generated by operating activities, we expect that our liquidity sources described above should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. Historically, from time to time, we have accessed the capital markets to issue debt and equity.•See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a discussion of interest rate risk and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities of $89 million for 2022 from 2021 was due primarily to growth in our core business, which was partially offset by a net decrease from changes in working capital. Changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants. We expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of changes in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.Investing Activities. Net cash used for investing activities for 2022 increased by $20 million from 2021 primarily as a result of increased discretionary capital expenditures in our Fiber segment. Our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining as described below. •Discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. The expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically varies based on, among other factors: (1) the type of communications infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. Currently, construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber (including certain construction projects that may take 18 to 36 months to complete). Our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.•Sustaining capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.33A summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows:For the Years EndedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021December 31, 2020(In millions of dollars)TowersFiberOtherTotalTowersFiberOtherTotalTowersFiberOtherTotalDiscretionary:Communications infrastructure improvements and other capital projects(a)$121 $1,017 $24 $1,162 $138 $905 $33 $1,076 $257 $1,179 $38 $1,474 Purchases of land interests53 — — 53 64 2 — 66 64 — — 64 Sustaining11 41 43 95 19 49 19 87 14 53 19 86 Total$185 $1,058 $67 $1,310 $221 $956 $52 $1,229 $335 $1,232 $57 $1,624  (a)Towers segment includes $48 million, $65 million and $113 million of capital expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with tenant installations and upgrades on our towers.Capital expenditures increased from 2021 to 2022 and were primarily impacted by the previously-mentioned increased discretionary capital expenditures in our Fiber segment. See \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Outlook Highlights\" for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2023 capital expenditures.Financing Activities. We seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities such as (in no particular order): (1) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total at least $6.26 per share over the next 12 months, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.7 billion), (2) purchasing our common stock or (3) purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. See \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend,\" \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview\" and notes 7, 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2022, our financing activities predominately related to the following:•paying an aggregate of $2.6 billion in dividends on our common stock;•issuing $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our CP Program and pay related fees and expenses;•prepaying in full the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1;•redeeming in full the previously outstanding 3.849% Secured Notes;•entering into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date from June 2026 to July 2027, (2) an increase to the aggregate commitments under the 2016 Revolver from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion, (3) certain modifications to a specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with the Term SOFR pricing benchmark; and•increasing the size of our CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 billion at any time outstanding.In 2021, our financing activities predominately related to the following:•paying an aggregate of $2.4 billion in dividends on our common stock;•issuing $3.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to (1) redeem all of the outstanding 5.250% Senior Notes, (2) repay a portion of the outstanding Commercial Paper Notes and (3) repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan A; •issuing $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, the net proceeds of which were used to (1) to repay in full the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class C-2022, (2) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the CP Program and (3) for general corporate purposes; and•entering into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date from June 2024 to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets and increases to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee.Incurrences, Purchases and Repayments of Debt. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview—Liquidity Position\" for further discussion of our recent issuances, purchases, redemptions and repayments of debt.34Common Stock. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our common stock as well as dividends declared and paid. ATM Program. In March 2021, we established the 2021 ATM Program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million. Sales under the 2021 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. See also note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our 2021 ATM Program. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. In July and August 2020, all of our approximately 2 million shares of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into approximately 14 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of our common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 8.8043 shares of common stock for each share of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the July and August conversions into shares of our common stock.Credit Facility. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our 2016 Credit Facility. As of February 21, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $265 million and $6.7 billion in undrawn availability under our 2016 Revolver. The proceeds of our 2016 Revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.Commercial Paper Program. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our CP Program. As of February 21, 2023, there was $1.2 billion outstanding under our CP Program. The proceeds from our Commercial Paper Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.Restricted Cash. Pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Material Cash RequirementsThe following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. These material cash requirements relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. The debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnote (b)). 35(In millions of dollars)Years Ending December 31,Material Cash Requirements20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalsDebt and other long-term obligations(a)$2,060 $831 $593 $2,771 $3,558 $12,078 $21,891 Interest payments on debt and other long-term obligations(b)(c)734 690 670 640 541 5,613 8,888 Lease obligations(d)568 561 545 538 531 5,660 8,403 Total material cash requirements$3,362 $2,082 $1,808 $3,949 $4,630 $23,351 $39,182  (a)The impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 (collectively, \"Tower Revenue Notes\") is not considered. The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the Tower Revenue Notes.(b)If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2022 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $1.0 billion. We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.(c)Includes the unused commitment fees on our 2016 Credit Facility. Interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds. Each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility. See \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for a discussion of our interest rate risk.(d)Amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations. See also the table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.The following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms exercisable at our option, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 36 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of retaining the rights to land under our towers. (a)Inclusive of fee interests and perpetual easements.(b)For the three months ended December 31, 2022, without consideration of the term of the tenant contract.36Debt CovenantsOur 2016 Credit Agreement contains financial maintenance covenants. We are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and, based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of compliance with our debt covenants. The following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the 2016 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022.

If applicable, the consolidated interest coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.50.37Accounting and Reporting MattersCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by GAAP. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. The critical accounting policies and estimates for 2022 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Lease Accounting—Lessee. For our Towers segment, our lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under our towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site and are generally for an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at our option. We also enter into term easements and ground leases in which we prepay the entire term. For our Fiber segment, our lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to facilitate our small cells and fiber solutions. The majority of our lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at our option. We include certain renewal option periods in the lease term when we determine that the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. For both our Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expense is recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require us to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of our ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, we consider all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. We calculate the straight-line expense over the contract's estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that we deem reasonably certain to be exercised.We recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset (and, as applicable, a corresponding lease liability) for each of our operating leases. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term, and lease liabilities represent the present value of our future lease payments. In assessing our leases and determining our lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, we are not able to readily determine the rate implicit for our lessee arrangements and thus use our incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of our lease payments. Our ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs.We review the carrying value of our ROU assets for impairment, similar to our other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of our ROU assets.Revenue Recognition. 90% of our total revenue for 2022 consisted of site rental revenues, which are recognized on a ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless tenants and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from fiber solutions tenants, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of our tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant's option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant's option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element (such as an escalator tied to an inflation-based index) in addition to a minimum. To the extent we acquire below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure (for example with respect to small cells and fiber), we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term. Since we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the site rental revenues in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods. Our assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are 38deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which we have an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the consolidated balance sheet.As part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, we also offer certain services primarily relating to our Towers segment, which represented 10% of our total revenues for 2022. Services and other revenues consists predominately of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). Our services generally have a duration of one year or less. Upon contract commencement, we assess our services to tenants and identify performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.We may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of the above performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which we believe we have transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price.The transaction price for tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to our towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under our tower installation services agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a ratable basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the tower installation service, we have one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues.Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet.Accounting for Acquisitions—General. The majority of our towers have been acquired directly or indirectly from the three largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999. We evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. For our business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Accounting and Reporting Matters—Accounting for Acquisitions—Valuation\" below. The determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized. Such changes could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Acquisitions—Leases. With respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases. The evaluation of such agreements for finance or operating lease treatment previously included consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under ASC 840-10-25, namely (1) the transfer of ownership provisions, (2) the existence of bargain purchase options, (3) the length of the remaining lease term, and (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments. With respect to the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we determined that the tower leases were finance leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion, after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under ASC 840-10-25 to leases involving both land and buildings (i.e., towers). We determined that the fragmentation criteria was met, and the tower leases could be accounted for as finance leases apart from the land leases, which are accounted for as operating leases, since (1) the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25% of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and (2) the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75% of the estimated economic life of the tower assets.Accounting for Acquisitions—Valuation. As of December 31, 2022, our largest asset was property and equipment (which primarily consists of communications infrastructure) followed by goodwill, operating lease ROU assets and intangible assets. Our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets.39The fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either:(1)discounted cash flow valuation methods (for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and tenant relationships or operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities acquired); or(2)estimates of replacement costs (for tangible fixed assets such as communications infrastructure).The purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements, including the amount of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. The most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are (1) the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and (2) the economic useful life after giving effect to age, quality, and condition. The most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are (1) discount rates and (2) timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding tenant renewals and cancellations. The most important estimates for measurement of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities acquired are (1) present value of our future lease payments, including whether renewals or extensions should be measured, and (2) favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms. With respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the AT&T and T-Mobile leased and subleased towers (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as finance or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options.We record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements, pursuant to our ground leases, easements, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which certain of our communications infrastructure resides. In determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to: (1) timing of cash flows, (2) future costs, (3) discount rates and (4) the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land. We do not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to our fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets—Useful Lives. We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization and accretion expense that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. A substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure, the majority of which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewals).The useful lives of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. We review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure.Accounting for Long-Lived Assets—Impairment Evaluation. We review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For purposes of our Towers segment, we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets:(1)we pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups; and(2)we separately pool the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate.40We first pool site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing, because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio. We re-evaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually. This use of grouping is based in part on (1) our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure, (2) the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios, and (3) the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace. The vast majority of our site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the U.S. owned communications infrastructure group. Secondly, and separately, we pool the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate, for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related tenant relationships acquired.For purposes of our Fiber segment, we consider major U.S. markets where we have made significant investments to be the most appropriate level for purposes of grouping our long-lived assets for potential impairment evaluation.Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset. When considering the utility of our assets, we consider events that would meaningfully impact (1) our communications infrastructure or (2) our tenant relationships. For example, consideration would be given to events that impact (1) the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or (2) our ability to derive benefit from our existing tenant relationships, including events such as tenant's bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant tenant. During 2022, there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations.If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset group is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. If the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. The most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are (1) the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and (2) estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of tenant contracts. We could record impairments in the future if changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets, or if we changed our unit of account in the future.Approximately 2% of our total towers currently have no tenants. We continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future, primarily because of the demographics and continuing increase in demand for data in the areas around these individual towers. We estimate, based on current visibility, potential tenants on a majority of these towers. To the extent we do not believe there are long-term prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value have been exhausted, including sale of the asset, we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value.Accounting for Goodwill—Impairment Evaluation. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. We then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would be required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments (Towers and Fiber). See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairments.Deferred Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our REIT taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining NOLs. Accordingly, the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to TRSs. Furthermore, as a result of the deduction for dividends paid, some or all of our NOLs related to our REIT may expire without utilization. See \"Item 1. Business—REIT Status\" for a discussion of the impact of our REIT status. 41Our TRSs will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our NOLs, we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance, which would reduce our earnings. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. The change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows. For a further discussion of our benefit (provision) for income taxes, see \"Item 7. MD&A—Results of Operations\" and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP and Segment Financial MeasuresIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein and as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, we also provide (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate the performance of our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. We define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. We define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.We use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of consolidated financial performance. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other REITs, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss), net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. There are material limitations to using a measure such as Adjusted EBITDA, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. Management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, stock-based compensation expense and net (gain) loss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) is set forth below: 42Years Ended December 31,(In millions of dollars)202220212020Net income (loss)$1,675 $1,096 $1,056 Adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):Asset write-down charges34 21 74 Acquisition and integration costs2 1 10 Depreciation, amortization and accretion1,707 1,644 1,608 Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments16 18 18 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs699 657 689 (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations28 145 95 Interest income(3)(1)(2)Other (income) expense10 21 5 (Benefit) provision for income taxes16 21 20 Stock-based compensation expense156 131 133 Net (gain) loss from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax— 62 — Adjusted EBITDA(a)$4,340 $3,816 $3,706  (a)The above reconciliation excludes the items included in our Adjusted EBITDA definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because:•it is the primary measure used by our management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations; •although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; •we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results; and •it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:•as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation; •as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results; •in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management; •for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget; •as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets; •in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio; and •with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios that incorporate concepts such as, or similar to, Adjusted EBITDA. 43Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur primary exposures to market risks are related to changes in interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates where economically prudent to do so by utilizing fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no interest rate swaps.Our interest rate risk as of December 31, 2022 relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom: •the potential refinancing of our $21.9 billion in existing debt, compared to $20.8 billion in the prior year;•our $2.7 billion of floating rate debt, compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year, representing approximately 13% and 10% of total debt, respectively; and•potential future borrowings of incremental debt, including borrowings under our 2016 Credit Facility and issuances under our CP Program.Over the past 11 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate eight times for a cumulative increase of 4.50% and has signaled further increases in the near-term, which could further increase our costs of borrowing. Prior to 2022, the Federal Reserve had not raised the federal funds rate since December 2018. See also \"Item 1a. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of risks stemming from interest rate increases.Potential Refinancing of Existing DebtOur contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, the 3.150% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt. See below for a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of December 31, 2022.Floating Rate DebtWe manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom, we had $2.7 billion of floating rate debt. A hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing floating rate debt of 1/4 of a percent point over a 12-month period would increase our interest expense by approximately $7 million.Potential Future Borrowings of Incremental DebtWe typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance. See \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\" regarding our liquidity strategy.44The following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates. The future principal payments and weighted-average interest rates are presented as of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to our January 2023 Senior Notes offering and the use of the net proceeds therefrom. These debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates, and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnotes (b) and (d)). See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt. Future Principal Payments and Interest Rates by the Debt Instruments' Contractual Year of Maturity(In millions of dollars)20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalFair Value(a)Fixed rate debt(b)$789 $786 $532 $2,680 $2,277 $12,078 $19,142 $15,816 Average interest rate(b)(c)(d)3.2 %3.3 %1.5 %3.0 %3.5 %4.1 %3.7 %Variable rate debt(e)$1,271 (f)$45 $60 $91 $1,281 $— $2,748 $3,738 Average interest rate(e)5.2 %4.8 %4.0 %4.0 %4.0 %— %4.6 % (a)The fair value of our debt is based on indicative quotes, non-binding quotes from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask offers.

The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and Series 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. (c)The average interest rate represents the weighted-average stated coupon rate (see also footnote (d)).(d)    If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2022 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $1.0 billion. We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates. (e)    Predominately consists of our senior unsecured term loan A facility (\"2016 Term Loan A\") and our 2016 Revolver borrowings, each of which matures in 2027. Additionally, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds. Each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility. (f)    Predominately consists of outstanding indebtedness under our CP Program. Such amounts may be issued, repaid or re-issued from time to time. 45Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary DataCrown Castle Inc. and SubsidiariesIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules  PageReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)47Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 202149Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 202250Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 202251Consolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 202252Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements53Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 202095Schedule III - Schedule of Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 20219646Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Crown Castle Inc.Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Crown Castle Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.47Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Revenue Recognition - Towers SegmentAs described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $4,322 million in site rental revenues and $685 million in services and other revenues from its Towers segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, noncancelable term of the relevant tenant contract. The Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (i) site development services and (ii) installation services. The transaction price for the Company's tower installation services consists of amounts for (i) permanent improvements to the Company's towers that represent a lease component and (ii) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company's tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for the Towers segment is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to tenant contracts and installation service agreements. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to revenue recognition for Towers. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification of the contractual terms by examining tenant contracts and installation service agreements on a test basis and (ii) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on contractual terms and estimated lease term for selected tenant contracts and installation service agreements./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaFebruary 24, 2023We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2011.48CROWN CASTLE INC.

(formerly, Crown Castle International Corp.) and its predecessor, as applicable (together, \"CCI\"), and their subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as the \"Company.\" All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As used herein, the term \"including,\" and any variation thereof, means \"including without limitation.\" The use of the word \"or\" herein is not exclusive. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to \"U.S.\" are to the United States of America and Puerto Rico, collectively.The Company owns, operates and leases shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., including (1) towers and other structures, such as rooftops (collectively, \"towers\"), and (2) fiber primarily supporting small cell networks (\"small cells\") and fiber solutions. The Company's towers, small cells and fiber assets are collectively referred to herein as \"communications infrastructure,\" and the Company's customers on its communications infrastructure are referred to herein as \"tenants.\" The Company's core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). The Company's operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. See note 14.Approximately 53% of the Company's towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). The Company has the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See notes 4 and 13.As part of the Company's effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). The Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Company has certain taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"). See note 9.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe following is a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies in effect for the year ended December 31, 2022.Restricted CashRestricted cash represents (1) the cash held in reserve by the indenture trustees pursuant to the indenture governing certain of the Company's debt instruments, (2) cash securing performance obligations such as letters of credit, as well as (3) any other cash whose use is limited by contractual provisions. The restriction of rental cash receipts is a critical feature of certain of the Company's debt instruments, due to the applicable indenture trustee's ability to utilize the restricted cash for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, (3) real estate or personal property taxes, (4) insurance premiums related to towers, (5) other assessments by governmental authorities and potential environmental remediation costs, or (6) a portion of advance rents from tenants. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See note 16 for a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.53NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Receivables AllowanceAn allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable. The Company uses judgment in estimating this allowance and considers historical collections, current credit status, or contractual provisions. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged either to \"Site rental costs of operations\" or to \"Services and other costs of operations,\" as appropriate, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible.Lease AccountingGeneral. The Company evaluates whether a contract meets the definition of a lease whenever a contract grants a party the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To the extent the identified asset is able to be shared among multiple parties, the Company has determined that one party does not have control of the identified asset and the contract is not considered a lease. The Company accounts for contracts that do not meet the definition of a lease under other relevant accounting guidance (such as ASC 606 for revenue from contracts with customers).Lessee. For its Tower segment, the Company's lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site, generally contain an initial term of five to 10 years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at the Company's option. The Company also enters into term easements and ground leases in which it prepays the entire term. For its Fiber segment, the Company's lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to support the Company's small cells and fiber solutions.The majority of the Company's lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at the Company's option. The Company includes renewal option periods in its calculation of the estimated lease term when it determines the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. When such renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain, the estimated lease term determined under ASC 842 will be greater than the non-cancelable term of the contractual arrangement. Although certain renewal periods are included in the estimated lease term, the Company would have the ability to terminate or elect to not renew a particular lease if business conditions warrant such a decision.The Company classifies its lessee arrangements at inception as either operating leases or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the five criteria described above for finance lease classification is met. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets associated with operating leases are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Current and long-term portions of lease liabilities related to operating leases are included in \"Current portion of operating lease liabilities\" and \"Operating lease liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, respectively. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's present value of its future lease payments. In assessing its leases and determining its lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, the Company is not able to readily determine the rate implicit for its lessee arrangements, and thus uses its incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company's ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs. For both the Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company's ground lease and fiber lease agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company calculates the straight-line expense over the contract's estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that the Company deems reasonably certain to be exercised.Lease agreements may also contain provisions for a contingent payment based on (1) the revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset, (2) the change in CPI or (3) the usage of the leased asset. The Company's contingent payments are considered variable lease payments and are (1) not included in the initial measurement of 54NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)the ROU asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and (2) recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.ROU assets associated with finance leases are included in \"Property and equipment, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities associated with finance leases are included in \"Current maturities of debt and other obligations\" and \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. For both its Towers and Fiber segments, the Company measures the lease liability for finance leases using the effective interest method. The initial lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the liability and decreased to reflect payments made during the period. Interest on the lease liability is determined each period during the lease term as the amount that results in a constant periodic discount rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The Company depreciates ROU assets for finance leases on a ratable basis over the applicable lease term.The Company reviews the carrying value of its ROU assets for impairment, similar to its other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of its ROU assets.Lessor. The Company's lessor arrangements primarily include tenant contracts for dedicated space (including dedicated fiber) on its shared communications infrastructure. The Company classifies its leases at inception as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. A lease is classified as a sales-type lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying assets or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. Furthermore, when none of the above criteria is met, a lease is classified as a direct financing lease if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the present value of the of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee, that is not already reflected in the lease payments, equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying asset and (2) it is probable that the lessor will collect the lease payments plus any amount necessary to satisfy a residual value guarantee. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not qualify as a sales-type or direct financing lease. Currently, the Company classifies all of its lessor arrangements as operating leases.Site rental revenues from the Company’s lessor arrangements are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating straight-line site rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions. Certain of the Company's arrangements with tenants in its Fiber segment contain both lease and non-lease components. In such circumstances, the Company has determined (1) the timing and pattern of transfer for the lease and non-lease component are the same and (2) the stand-alone lease component would be classified as an operating lease. As such, the Company has aggregated certain non-lease components with lease components and has determined that the lease components (generally dedicated fiber) represent the predominant component of the arrangement.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment includes land owned in fee and perpetual easements for land, which have no definite life. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Depreciation for the majority of communications infrastructure is computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewal periods). Additions and permanent improvements to the Company's communications infrastructure are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed.Labor and interest costs incurred directly related to the construction of certain property and equipment are capitalized during the construction phase of projects. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $265 million, $238 million and $270 million in capitalized labor costs, respectively. The carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.55NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Abandonments and write-offs of property and equipment are recorded to \"Asset write-down charges\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and were $39 million, $19 million and $77 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Asset write-down charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the write-off of property and equipment of approximately $63 million which, following the 2020 Cancellation, was deemed to have no alternative future use. See note 15 for further information regarding the 2020 Cancellation.Asset Retirement ObligationsPursuant to its ground lease, easement, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, the Company records obligations to perform asset retirement activities, including requirements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space on which certain of its communications infrastructure is located. The Company does not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to its fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Asset retirement obligations are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The liability accretes as a result of the passage of time and the related accretion expense is included in \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as an additional carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of such asset.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price for an acquired business over the allocated value of the related net assets. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. The Company's reporting units are the same as its operating segments (Towers and Fiber). The Company then performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022, which resulted in no impairments.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are included in \"Site rental contracts and tenant relationships, net\" and \"Other intangible assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and predominately consist of the estimated fair value of site rental contracts and tenant relationships or other contractual rights, such as trademarks, that are recorded in conjunction with acquisitions. Site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are comprised of (1) the current term of the existing leases, (2) the high rate of tenant retention, and (3) any associated relationships that are expected to generate value following the expiration of all renewal periods under existing leases. The useful lives of intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit the Company and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships, which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite useful lives will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company has a dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets. First, the Company pools site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets with the related communications infrastructure assets into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for 56NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)impairment testing. Second and separately, the Company pools the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate. If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset.Deferred CreditsDeferred credits are included in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and consist of the estimated fair value of below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on acquired communications infrastructure that are amortized to site rental revenues.Fair value for these deferred credits represents the difference between (1) the stated contractual payments to be made pursuant to the in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding lease. Deferred credits are measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining economic lease term considering renewal provisions or economics associated with those renewal provisions, to the extent applicable. Deferred credits are amortized over their respected estimated lease terms at the time of acquisition.Deferred Financing CostsThird-party costs incurred to obtain financing, with the exception of costs incurred related to revolving lines of credit, are deferred and are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability in \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the related debt liability. Third party costs incurred to obtain financing through a revolving line of credit are deferred and are included in \"Other assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement (as defined in note 7).Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Typically, providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site Rental Revenues. Site rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, which generally ranges from five to 15 years for wireless tenants and three to 20 years for the Company's fiber solutions tenants (including from organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of the tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant's option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant's option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating straight-line rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.Services and Other Revenues. As part of the Company’s effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment, predominately consisting of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. Upon contract commencement, the Company assesses its services to tenants and identifies performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.57NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The Company may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of these performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which the Company believes it has transferred goods or services to the tenant. The revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective contract based on estimated standalone selling price. The volume and mix of site development services may vary among contracts and may include a combination of some or all of the above performance obligations. Payments generally are due within 45 to 60 days and generally do not contain variable-consideration provisions. The transaction price for the Company's tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to the Company's towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company's tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues on the Company consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of the Company’s services generally have a duration of one year or less.Additional Information on Revenues. As of January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, a total of $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of unrecognized revenue was reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $668 million of the January 1, 2022 unrecognized revenue balance was recognized as revenue. As of January 1, 2021, a total of $2.8 billion of unrecognized revenue was reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately $595 million of the January 1, 2021 unrecognized revenue balance was recognized as revenue.See note 3 for further discussion regarding the Company’s revenues.Costs of OperationsApproximately half of the Company's site rental costs of operations expenses consist of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses, property taxes, repairs and maintenance expenses, employee compensation or related benefit costs, or utilities. Generally, the ground leases for land are specific to each site and are for an initial term of five years and are renewable for pre-determined periods. The Company also enters into term easements and ground leases in which it prepays the entire term in advance. Fiber access expenses primarily consist of leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate the Company's communications infrastructure. Ground lease and fiber access expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company's ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, the Company considers all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's liability related to straight-line expense is included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company's assets related to prepaid agreements is included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.Services and other costs of operations predominately consist of third-party service providers such as contractors and professional services firms and, to a lesser extent, internal labor costs, associated with the Company's site development and installation services. The Company's costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of associated performance obligations of $43 million and $65 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.The Company recognized $20 million as costs of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a reduction in staffing completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Such costs were comprised of employee severance payments and termination benefits and primarily impacted the Company's Fiber segment.58NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Acquisitions and Integration CostsDirect or incremental costs related to a potential or completed business combination transaction are expensed as incurred. Such costs are predominately comprised of severance, retention bonuses payable to employees of an acquired enterprise, temporary employees to assist with the integration of the acquired operations, fees paid for services (such as consulting, accounting, legal, or engineering reviews), and any other costs directly associated with the transaction. These business combination costs are included in \"Acquisition and integration costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For those transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.Stock-based CompensationRestricted Stock Units. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for unvested restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of RSUs for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered is recognized in the period of the change in the estimate. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the awards vest. A discussion of the Company's valuation techniques and related assumptions and estimates used to measure the Company's stock-based compensation is as follows:Valuation. The fair value of RSUs without market conditions is determined based on the number of shares relating to such RSUs and the quoted price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs with market conditions granted using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Company's determination of the fair value of RSUs with market conditions on the date of grant is affected by its common stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex or subjective variables. The determination of fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation requires the input of subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results.Amortization Method. The Company amortizes the fair value of all RSUs on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting tranche of the award (graded vesting schedule) over the requisite service periods. Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock.Expected Dividend Rate. The expected dividend rate at the date of grant is based on the then-current dividend yield.Risk-Free Rate. The Company bases the risk-free rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.Forfeitures. The Company uses historical award forfeiture data and management's judgment about the future employee turnover rates to estimate the number of shares for which the requisite service period will not be rendered.Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing CostsThe components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Interest expense on debt obligations$685 $644 $683 Amortization of deferred financing costs and adjustments on long-term debt26 25 23 Capitalized interest(12)(12)(17)Total$699 $657 $689 The Company amortizes deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums over the estimated term of the related borrowing using the effective interest yield method. Deferred financing costs and discounts are generally presented as a direct reduction to the related debt obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 59NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Income TaxesThe Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its net taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders. The Company also may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income and (2) taxes related to the TRSs. In addition, the Company could under certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. Additionally, the Company has included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located. The Company's foreign assets and operations (including its tower operations in Puerto Rico) are subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether they are included in a TRS or not. For its REIT conversion and certain subsequent acquisitions into the REIT, the Company will be subject to a federal corporate level tax rate (currently 21%) on any gain recognized from the sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally 5 years) after the transfer date up to the amount of the built in gain that existed on the transfer date, which is based upon the fair market value of those assets in excess of the Company's tax basis on the transfer date. This gain can be offset by any remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\").For the Company's TRSs, the Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that the asset will not be realized. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets each quarter and based upon projections of future taxable income, reversing deferred tax liabilities or other known events that are expected to affect future taxable income, records a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the \"more likely than not\" realization threshold. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based upon changes in facts and circumstances that impact the recoverability of the asset.The Company recognizes a tax position if it is \"more likely than not\" that it will be sustained upon examination. The tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the benefit (provision) for income taxes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not recorded any material penalties related to its income tax positions. See note 9.Per Share InformationBasic net income (loss), per common share, excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, diluted net income (loss), per common share, is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus any potential dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units as determined under the treasury stock method and (2) conversion of the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (\"6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock\"), as applicable, as determined under the if-converted method.60NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations is shown in the table below.  Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,675 $1,158 $1,056 Dividends/distributions on preferred stock— — (57)Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to CCI common stockholders for basic and diluted computations$1,675 $1,158 $999 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$— $(62)$— Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders$1,675 $1,096 $999 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (in millions):Basic weighted-average number of common stock outstanding433 432 423 Effect of assumed dilution from potential issuance of common shares relating to RSUs1 2 2 Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding434 434 425 Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders, per common share:Income (loss) from continuing operations, basic$3.87 $2.68 $2.36 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, basic— (0.14)— Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders—basic$3.87 $2.54 $2.36 Income (loss) from continuing operations, diluted$3.86 $2.67 $2.35 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, diluted— (0.14)— Net income (loss) attributable to CCI common stockholders—diluted$3.86 $2.53 $2.35 Dividends/distributions declared per share of common stock$5.98 $5.46 $4.93 For the year ended December 31, 2020, 14 million common share equivalents related to the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock were excluded from the dilutive common shares, because the impact of the conversion of such preferred stock would be anti-dilutive based on the Company's common stock price at the end of each respective year. See note 10 for further discussion of the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Convertible Preferred Stock. Fair ValuesThe Company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are (1) Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active and accessible markets, (2) Level 2 — observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data, and (3) Level 3 — unobservable inputs and are not corroborated by market data. The Company evaluates fair value hierarchy level classifications quarterly, and transfers between levels are effective at the end of the quarterly period.The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate the carrying values. The Company determines the fair value of its debt securities based on indicative, non-binding quotes from brokers. Quotes from brokers require judgment and are based on the brokers' interpretation of market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices or quotes from active markets if available. There were no changes since December 31, 2021 in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair values. See note 8 for a further discussion of fair values. 61NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsNo accounting pronouncements adopted during the year ended December 31, 2022 had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedNo new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted are expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.3.RevenuesThe following table is a summary of the contracted amounts owed to the Company by tenants pursuant to tenant contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022.

The Company has the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.62NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 31% of the Company's towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). Approximately half of such towers have an initial term of 32 years (through May 2037), and the Company has the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of such leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile for approximately $2.3 billion. The remainder of such towers have a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin, and the Company has the option to purchase such towers from T-Mobile at the end of the respective terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. In addition, another 1% of the Company's towers under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with T-Mobile are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with AT&T. The Company has the option to purchase these towers from AT&T at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due prior to 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).See note 13 for further discussion of finance leases recorded as \"Property and equipment, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.5.Goodwill and Intangible Assets GoodwillThe carrying value of goodwill was $10.1 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

See further discussion below regarding potential adjustments to such percentages.(f)The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes, as defined below, when outstanding, may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance.65NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The credit agreement governing the Company's 2016 Credit Facility (\"2016 Credit Agreement\") contains financial maintenance covenants. The Company is currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants, and based upon current expectations, the Company believes it will continue to comply with its financial maintenance covenants. In addition, certain of the Company's debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on CCI or its subsidiaries and may limit the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase the Company's securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow.Bank Debt2016 Credit Facility. In January 2016, the Company established the 2016 Credit Facility, which was originally comprised of (1) a $2.5 billion 2016 Revolver maturing in January 2021, (2) a $2.0 billion 2016 Term Loan A maturing in January 2021 and (3) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility (\"364-Day Facility\") maturing in January 2017. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 Credit Facility (1) to repay the then outstanding senior credit facility originally established in January 2012 and (2) for general corporate purposes. In February 2016, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the February 2016 Senior Notes (as defined below) offering to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the then outstanding 364-Day Facility. In February 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and (2) extend the maturity of both the 2016 Term Loan A and the 2016 Revolver to January 2022. In August 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $3.5 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to August 2022.In June 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $4.25 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2023. In June 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $5.0 billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2024.In June 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread (\"Spread\") and unused commitment fee (\"Commitment Fee\") percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets (\"Targets\") and increases to the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds (\"Thresholds\") and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to an upward adjustment of up to 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively, if the Company fails to achieve the Thresholds. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to a downward adjustment of up to 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively, if the Company achieves the Targets. In January 2022, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of December 31, 2021, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentages were reduced for 2022.In July 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to July 2027, (2) an increase to the commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $7.0 billion, (3) certain modifications to the specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with a Term SOFR pricing benchmark.In January 2023, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of December 31, 2022, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage reductions applied in January 2022 were maintained for 2023.66NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Commercial Paper Program. In April 2019, the Company established a commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\"). Commercial Paper Notes may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with an aggregate principal amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time originally not to exceed $1.0 billion. The net proceeds of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes, when outstanding, may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper Notes are issued under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, can be issued at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. At any point in time, the Company intends to maintain available commitments under its 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. While any outstanding commercial paper issuances generally have short-term maturities, the Company classifies the outstanding issuances as long-term based on its ability and intent to refinance the outstanding issuances on a long-term basis.In March 2022, the Company increased the size of the CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.0 billion at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net issuances of $1.2 billion under the CP Program. Securitized DebtThe Tower Revenue Notes and the Secured Notes, Series 2009-1, Class A-2 (\"2009 Securitized Notes\") (collectively, \"Securitized Debt\") are obligations of special purpose entities and their direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an \"issuer\"), all of which are wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of CCI. The Tower Revenue Notes and 2009 Securitized Notes are governed by separate indentures. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes and 2018 Tower Revenue Notes (each as defined below) are governed by one indenture and consist of multiple series of notes, each with its own anticipated repayment date.In May 2015, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2015 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company's then outstanding Tower Revenue Notes. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.222% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2022 and a final maturity date of May 2042 (\"Series 2015-1 Notes\") and (2) $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.663% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2025 and a final maturity date of May 2045 (\"Series 2015-2 Notes\"). The Company primarily used the net proceeds of the 2015 Tower Revenue Notes, together with proceeds received from the Company's sale of the formerly 77.6% owned subsidiary that operated towers in Australia (\"CCAL\"), to (1) repay $250 million aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding August 2010 Tower Revenue Notes, (2) repay all of the then outstanding WCP Secured Wireless Site Contracts Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1 (\"WCP Securitized Notes\"), (3) repay portions of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility and (4) pay related fees and expenses. In June 2021, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2021 Senior Notes (as defined below) offering to repay in whole the Series 2015-1 Notes.In July 2018, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2018 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company's existing Tower Revenue Notes. The 2018 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.720% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2023 and a final maturity of July 2043 (\"Series 2018-1 Notes\") and (2) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.241% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2028 and a final maturity of July 2048 (\"Series 2018-2 Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2010-6 and to pay related fees and expenses. In addition to the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes described above, in connection with Exchange Act risk retention requirements (\"Risk Retention Rules\"), an indirect subsidiary of the Company issued and a majority-owned affiliate of the Company purchased approximately $53 million of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1, Class R-2028 to retain an eligible horizontal residual interest (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes. In March 2022, the Company prepaid the Series 2018-1 Notes.The Securitized Debt is paid solely from the cash flows generated by the operation of the towers held directly and indirectly by the issuers of the respective Securitized Debt. The Securitized Debt is secured by, among other things, (1) a security interest in substantially all of the applicable issuers' assignable personal property, (2) a pledge of the equity interests in each applicable issuer and (3) a security interest in the applicable issuers' leases with tenants to lease tower space (space licenses). The governing instruments of two indirect subsidiaries (\"Crown Atlantic\" and \"Crown GT\") of the issuers of the 67NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Tower Revenue Notes generally prevent them from issuing debt and granting liens on their assets without the approval of a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. Consequently, while distributions paid by Crown Atlantic and Crown GT will service the Tower Revenue Notes, the Tower Revenue Notes are not obligations of, nor are the Tower Revenue Notes secured by the cash flows or any other assets of, Crown Atlantic and Crown GT. As of December 31, 2022, the Securitized Debt was collateralized with personal property and equipment with an aggregate net book value of approximately $813 million, exclusive of Crown Atlantic and Crown GT personal property and equipment.The excess cash flows from the issuers of the Securitized Debt, after the payment of principal, interest, reserves, expenses and management fees, are distributed to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (\"DSCR\") (as defined in the applicable governing loan agreement) as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to a certain level, then all excess cash flow of the issuers of the applicable debt instrument will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Company. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Company until the DSCR exceeds a certain level for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the DSCR falls below a certain level as of the end of any calendar quarter, then all cash on deposit in the reserve account along with future excess cash flows of the issuers will be applied to prepay the debt with applicable prepayment consideration.The Company may repay the Securitized Debt in whole or in part at any time, provided in each case that such prepayment is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration. The Securitized Debt has covenants and restrictions customary for rated securitizations, including provisions prohibiting the issuers from incurring additional indebtedness or further encumbering their assets. Bonds—Senior NotesIn March 2022, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior unsecured notes due March 2027 (\"March 2022 Senior Notes\").

These amounts include approximately $237 million of losses related to stock-based compensation. The Company also has foreign NOLs of $32 million. If not utilized, the Company's U.S. federal NOLs expire starting in 2025 and ending in 2036, the state NOLs started expiring in 2022 and end in 2036, and the foreign NOLs expire starting in 2023 and ending in 2036. The utilization of the NOLs is subject to certain limitations. The Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns generally remain open to examination by taxing authorities until three years after the applicable NOLs have been used or expired.As of December 31, 2022, there were no unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. From time to time, the Company is subject to examinations by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. At this time, the Company is not subject to an Internal Revenue Service examination.On April 26, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement in principle with the Australian Taxation Office (\"ATO\") to pay A$83 million to settle the previously disclosed outstanding audit of the Australian tax consequences of the Company’s 2015 sale of Crown Castle Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (\"CCAL\"), formerly a 77.6% owned Australian subsidiary of the Company (\"ATO Settlement\"). The sale of CCAL generated approximately $1.2 billion in net proceeds to the Company, and resulted in a gain from the disposal of discontinued operations of $979 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.On June 16, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the ATO evidencing the ATO Settlement. On July 1, 2021, the Company paid approximately $62 million (A$83 million), based on the exchange rate in effect on that date, pursuant to the ATO Settlement. The Company recognized the ATO Settlement as a charge within discontinued 72NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)operations in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021, as this amount represented a reduction to the gain from the disposal of discontinued operations previously reported during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company reflected the payment pursuant to the ATO Settlement within discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021.The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it has business operations. The Company has no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company does not believe any such additional assessments arising from other examinations or audits will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.As of December 31, 2022, the Company's deferred tax assets are included in \"Other assets, net\" and the Company's deferred tax liabilities are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 10.Equity2021 \"At-the-Market\" Stock Offering ProgramIn March 2021, the Company established an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program through which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million (\"2021 ATM Program\"). Sales under the 2021 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to the Company's specific instructions, at negotiated prices. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2021 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. The Company has not sold any shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program. Convertible Preferred Stock ConversionIn July and August 2020, all of the approximately 2 million shares of the Company's previously outstanding 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 14 million shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 8.8043 shares of common stock per each share of 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Declaration and Payment of DividendsDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the following dividends/distributions were declared or paid:Equity TypeDeclaration DateRecord DatePayment DateDividends Per ShareAggregate Payment Amount(a)Common StockFebruary 8, 2022March 15, 2022March 31, 2022$1.470 $639 Common StockMay 10, 2022June 15, 2022June 30, 2022$1.470 $638 Common StockJuly 25, 2022September 15, 2022September 30, 2022$1.470 $636 Common StockOctober 20, 2022December 15, 2022December 30, 2022$1.565 $674  (a)Inclusive of dividends accrued for holders of unvested RSUs, which will be paid when and if the RSUs vest.See also note 17 for a discussion of the Company's common stock dividend declared in February 2023.73NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Tax Treatment of DividendsThe following table summarizes, for income tax purposes, the nature of dividends paid during 2022 on the Company's common stock.Equity TypePayment DateCash Distribution (per share)Ordinary Taxable Dividend (per share)Qualified Taxable Dividend (per share)(a)Section 199A Dividend (per share)Non-Taxable Distribution (per share)Common StockMarch 31, 2022$1.470000 $0.965086 $0.015821 $0.949265 $0.504914 Common StockJune 30, 2022$1.470000 $0.965086 $0.015821 $0.949265 $0.504914 Common StockSeptember 30, 2022$1.470000 $0.965086 $0.015821 $0.949265 $0.504914 Common StockDecember 30, 2022$1.565000 $1.027456 $0.016844 $1.010612 $0.537544  (a)Qualified taxable dividend and section 199A dividend amounts are included in ordinary taxable dividend amounts.Purchases of the Company's Common StockDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased 0.4 million, 0.4 million and 0.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, utilizing $65 million, $70 million and $76 million in cash, respectively.11.Stock-based CompensationStock Compensation PlansPursuant to stockholder approved plans, the Company has granted stock-based awards to certain employees, consultants or non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates. Following the stockholder approval of the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"2022 LTIP\"), no further awards can be made under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"2013 LTIP\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 3 million shares available for issuance under existing awards pursuant to the 2013 LTIP and approximately 13 million shares available for issuance under existing and future awards pursuant to the 2022 LTIP. Of the shares remaining available for future issuance, approximately 2 million shares may be issued pursuant to outstanding RSUs granted under the 2013 LTIP.Restricted Stock UnitsThe Company issues RSUs to certain executives and employees. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock subject to satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms. The RSUs granted to certain executives and employees include (1) annual performance awards that generally include provisions for forfeiture by the employee if certain market performance of the Company's common stock (as further described below) is not achieved, (2) new hire or promotional awards that generally contain only service-based vesting conditions and (3) other awards related to specific business initiatives or compensation objectives including retention and merger integration. Generally, such awards vest over periods of approximately three years.The following is a summary of the RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2022. RSUs (In millions)Outstanding at the beginning of year2 Granted1 Vested(1)Forfeited— Outstanding at end of year2 The Company granted approximately one million RSUs to its executives and certain other employees for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of the grants for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $146.52, $155.01 and $160.78 per share, respectively. The weighted-average requisite service period for the RSUs granted during 2022 was approximately 2.3 years.74NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Of the approximately one million RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2022, (1) approximately 0.7 million RSUs were subject to time-based vesting conditions, vesting over a three-year period and (2) approximately 0.4 million RSUs were granted to the Company's executives and certain other employees and may vest on the third anniversary of the grant date based upon (a) the Company's total stockholder returns (defined as share price appreciation plus the value of dividends paid during the performance period) and (b) the Company's total stockholder return compared to that of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Certain RSU agreements contain provisions that result in forfeiture by the employee of any unvested shares in the event that the Company's common stock does not achieve certain performance targets. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the market performance target is achieved. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation to determine the grant-date fair value for the RSUs with market conditions granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.  Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Risk-free rate1.7 %0.2 %1.4 %Expected volatility31 %30 %19 %Expected dividend rate3.0 %3.4 %3.5 %The Company recognized aggregate stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs of $134 million, $110 million and $111 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The explosion resulted in two fatalities, physical injuries (some of which were serious), and property damage to surrounding buildings and businesses. Currently, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an outcome or estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these lawsuits.75NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Other MattersThe Company is involved in various other claims, assessments, lawsuits or proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such other matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs or losses that may be incurred, if any, management believes the adverse resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Additionally, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are contingently liable for commitments or performance guarantees arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain letters of credit or surety bonds. See note 13 for a discussion of operating lease commitments. In addition, see note 4 for a discussion of the Company's option to purchase approximately 53% of its towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options.13.LeasesLessor Tenant LeasesSee note 3 for further information regarding the contractual amounts owed to the Company pursuant to tenant contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022 and other information.Lessee Operating LeasesThe components of the Company's operating lease expense are as follows:Years Ended December 31,202220212020Lease cost:Operating lease expense(a)$660 $646 $640 Variable lease expense(b)175 164 153 Total lease expense(c)$835 $810 $793  (a)Represents the Company's operating lease expense related to its ROU assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.(b)Represents the Company's expense related to contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Such contingencies are recognized as expense in the period they are resolved.(c)Excludes those direct operating expenses accounted for pursuant to accounting guidance outside the scope of ASC 842.Lessee Finance LeasesThe vast majority of the Company's finance leases are related to the towers subject to prepaid master lease agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint), and are recorded as \"Property and equipment, net\" on the consolidated balance sheet. See note 4 for further discussion of the Company's prepaid master lease agreements. Finance leases and associated leasehold improvements related to gross property and equipment and accumulated depreciation were $4.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Finance leases and associated leasehold improvements related to gross property and equipment and accumulated depreciation were $4.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $182 million, $200 million and $211 million, respectively, to \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" related to finance leases. Other Lessee InformationAs of December 31, 2022, the Company's weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for operating leases were 16 years and 3.6%, respectively.76NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The following table is a summary of the Company's maturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022:Years Ending December 31,ThereafterTotal undiscounted lease paymentsLess: Imputed interestTotal operating lease liabilities20232024202520262027Operating leases(a)$568 $561 $545 $538 $531 $5,660 $8,403 $(2,172)$6,231  (a)Excludes the Company's contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from the Company's operating lease liability. Such contingencies are recognized as expense in the period they are resolved.14.Operating Segments and Concentrations of Credit RiskOperating SegmentsThe Company's operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. The Towers segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's more than 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The Towers segment also reflects certain ancillary services relating to the Company's towers, predominately consisting of site development services and installation services. The Fiber segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's approximately (1) 120,000 small cells on air or under contract and (2) 85,000 route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cells and fiber solutions geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The measurements of profit or loss used by the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") to evaluate the performance of its operating segments are (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment services and other gross margin and (3) segment operating profit. The Company defines segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. The Company defines segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, and segment other operating (income) expense, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately.Costs that are directly attributable to Towers and Fiber are assigned to those respective segments. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in the Company's segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. The \"Other\" column (1) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest income, other income (expense), income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense, and (2) reconciles segment operating profit to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segment’s performance. The \"Other\" total assets balance includes corporate assets such as cash and cash equivalents which have not been allocated to specific segments. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company's operating segments.77NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Year Ended December 31, 2022TowersFiberOtherConsolidatedTotalSegment site rental revenues$4,322 $1,967 $6,289 Segment services and other revenues685 12 697 Segment revenues5,007 1,979 6,986 Segment site rental costs of operations918 650 1,568 Segment services and other costs of operations447 9 456 Segment costs of operations(a)(b)1,365 659 2,024 Segment site rental gross margin3,404 1,317 4,721 Segment services and other gross margin238 3 241 Segment selling, general and administrative expenses(b)115 190 305 Segment operating profit (loss)3,527 1,130 4,657 Other selling, general and administrative expenses(b)$317 317 Stock-based compensation expense156 156 Depreciation, amortization and accretion1,707 1,707 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs699 699 Other (income) expenses to reconcile to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes(c)87 87 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes$1,691 Capital expenditures$185 $1,058 $67 $1,310 Total assets (at year end)$22,210 $16,010 $701 $38,921 Total goodwill (at year end)$5,127 $4,958 $— $10,085  (a)Exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion shown separately.(b)Segment costs of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 excludes (1) stock-based compensation expense of $28 million and (2) prepaid lease purchase price adjustments of $16 million.

On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint announced the completion of their previously disclosed merger.Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivables. The Company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents by maintaining such deposits at high credit quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions. The Company's restricted cash is predominately held and directed by a trustee (see note 2). The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues from tenants in the wireless industry. The Company also has a concentration in its volume of business with T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless or their agents that accounts for a significant portion of the Company's revenues, receivables and deferred site rental receivables. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its tenants, the use of tenant leases with contractually determinable payment terms or proactive management of past due balances.79NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 15.Other Operating IncomeDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, T-Mobile notified the Company that it was cancelling approximately 5,700 small cells initially contracted with Sprint (\"2020 Cancellation\") prior to its merger with T-Mobile. The majority of the cancelled small cells were not yet constructed and, upon completion, would have been located at the same locations as other T-Mobile small cells. The 2020 Cancellation resulted in T-Mobile accelerating payment of all contractual rental obligations associated with the approximately 5,700 small cells as well as the payment of capital costs incurred to date.The Company received approximately $308 million from T-Mobile pursuant to the 2020 Cancellation, and recognized receipt of this payment as \"Other operating income\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Company previously received upfront payments from Sprint for certain of the small cells subject to the 2020 Cancellation, which the Company previously recorded as \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on its consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the 2020 Cancellation, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized the unamortized portion of such upfront payments, or approximately $54 million, as \"Other operating income\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020.See also note 2 for a discussion of the Company's separate evaluation and write-off during the year ended December 31, 2020 of property and equipment previously recorded related to the cancelled small cells.16.Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe following table is a summary of the supplemental cash flow information during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.  Years Ended December 31, 202220212020Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information:Cash payments related to operating lease liabilities(a)$560 $550 $538 Interest paid684 661 653 Income taxes paid 10 20 19 Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities:New ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities191 573 627 Increase (decrease) in accounts payable for purchases of property and equipment(5)3 27 Purchase of property and equipment under finance leases and installment land purchases28 25 33  (a)Excludes the Company's contingent payments pursuant to operating leases, which are recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.The reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within various lines on the consolidated balance sheet to amounts reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows is shown below.As of December 31,202220212020Cash and cash equivalents$156 $292 $232 Restricted cash, current166 169 144 Restricted cash reported within other assets, net5 5 5 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$327 $466 $381  17.Subsequent EventsCommon Stock DividendOn February 7, 2023, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.565 per common share.

Based upon their evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's CEO and CFO, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Based on the Company's assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K.(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.(d) Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsBecause of its inherent limitations, the Company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.82Item 9B.    Other InformationOn February 23, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective upon filing, to correct an error contained in the Certificate of Amendment to the Charter filed on May 20, 2022 (\"Amendment\") in connection with an increase of authorized shares. The Amendment inadvertently included an incorrect number of the Company’s total authorized shares of stock and shares of common stock that were previously approved by the board of directors and stockholders.The foregoing summary description of the Certificate of Correction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Correction, filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference.
